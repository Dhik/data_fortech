Limited data focus on dynamic myocardial injury during the course of chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer. Purpose: To investigate the variation of tissue characterization and myocardial deformation derived by cardiac MRI during anthracycline chemotherapy. Study Type: Prospective. Population: Fifty-eight female breast cancer patients (mean age: 52.82 ± 2.61 years) were enrolled. Field Strength/Sequence: A 3.0-T, cardiac MRI including cine balanced steady-state free precession, a modified Looker-Locker inversion recovery (MOLLI), and a fast spin echo (FSE) T2-weighted sequences were performed. Assessment: Cardiac MRI was performed baseline and after two, four, and six cycles of chemotherapy. Assessment of global longitudinal strain (GLS), global circumstance strain (GCS), global radial strain (GRS), and strain rate (GLS-s, GCS-s, GRS-s) and T1, T2 and T2* were accomplished by CVI42. The anthracycline dose and risk factors were also collected before each cardiac MRI. Statistical Tests: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures was used to compare the changes in LVEF cardiac function, strain and T1/T2/T2* parameters over time. Pearson correlation analyses were performed to estimate the potential associations between differences in myocardial characteristics (∆) and the chemotherapy cycle. A P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: LVEF was not significantly different from pretreatment MRI regarding each cycle of chemotherapy (P = 0.54). Compared with baseline, patients had significantly lower GLS (−15.85% ± 0.83%, −14.50% ± 0.88%, −12.34% ± 1.01% vs. –18.82% ± 0.92%) and GLS-s (−0.71% ± 0.07%, −0.65% ± 0.05%, −0.64% ± 0.04% vs. –0.95 ± 0.06%) and increased T2 values (57.21 ± 4.27 msec, 58.60 ± 3.93 msec, 58.10 ± 3.17 msec vs. 43.88 ± 3.28 msec) at two, four and six cycles of chemotherapy treatment. ∆GLS and ∆GLS-s were significantly associated with the chemotherapy cycle (correlation coefficients for GLS = 0.75, GLS-s = 0.75). Data Conclusion: Cardiac MRI can precisely detect the dynamic changes of anthracycline-induced subclinical myocardial injury that is represented as a gradually decrease in GLS and GLS-s. These parameters may provide new insight for monitoring risk and therapy in patients with breast cancer. Evidence Level: 2.

We report results from a prospective clinical trial evaluating early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and serum biomarker changes as predictors of cardiac injury and risk of subsequent cardiac events after RT for left-sided disease. Methods: Women with node-negative and node-positive (N-/+) left-sided BC were enrolled on 2 institutional review board (IRB)–approved protocols at 2 institutions. MRI was conducted pretreatment (within 1 week of starting radiation), at the end of treatment (last day of treatment ±1 week), and 3 months after the last day of treatment (±2 weeks) to quantify left and right ventricular volumes and function, myocardial fibrosis, and edema. Perfusion changes during regadenoson stress perfusion were also assessed on a subset of patients (n = 28). Serum was collected at the same time points. Whole heart and cardiac substructures were contoured using CT and MRI. Models were constructed using baseline cardiac and clinical risk factors. Associations between MRI-measured changes and dose were evaluated. Results: Among 51 women enrolled, mean heart dose ranged from 0.80 to 4.7 Gy and mean left ventricular (LV) dose from 1.1 to 8.2 Gy, with mean heart dose 2.0 Gy. T1 time, a marker of fibrosis, and right ventricular (RV) ejection fraction (EF) significantly changed with treatment; these were not dose dependent. T2 (marker of edema) and LV EF did not significantly change. No risk factors were associated with baseline global perfusion. Prior receipt of doxorubicin was marginally associated with decreased myocardial perfusion after RT (P = .059), and mean MHD was not associated with perfusion changes. A significant correlation between baseline IL-6 and mean heart dose (MHD) at the end of RT (ρ 0.44, P = .007) and a strong trend between troponin I and MHD at 3 months post-treatment (ρ 0.33, P = .07) were observed. No other significant correlations were identified. Conclusions: In this prospective study of women with left-sided breast cancer treated with contemporary treatment planning, cardiac radiation doses were very low relative to historical doses reported by Darby et al. Although we observed significant changes in T1 and RV EF shortly after RT, these changes were not correlated with whole heart or substructure doses. Serum biomarker analysis of cardiac injury demonstrates an interesting trend between markers and MHD that warrants further investigation. © 2021","","Biomarkers; Breast Neoplasms; Cardiotoxicity; Female; Heart; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Prospective Studies; Biomarkers; Computerized tomography; Disease control; Diseases; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Radiotherapy; amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; biological marker; brain natriuretic peptide; C reactive protein; cholesterol; gadolinium; high density lipoprotein; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; low density lipoprotein; triacylglycerol; troponin; troponin T; biological marker; Breast Cancer; Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging; Clinical trial; Ejection fraction; Left ventricular; Radiation-induced; Right ventricular; Risk factors; Serum biomarkers; Ventricular ejection; adult; Article; coronary artery disease; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; human; human tissue; major clinical study; myocarditis; T2 weighted imaging; breast tumor; cardiotoxicity; clinical trial; diagnostic imaging; heart; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; phase 2 clinical trial; prospective study; Heart","L.J.

This study aimed to evaluate the early signs of diffuse fibrosis after RT and their evolution during a six-year follow-up. Methods: Thirty patients with early-stage left-sided breast cancer were studied with echocardiography and electrocardiography (ECG) at baseline, after RT, and at three-year and six-year follow-up visits. Echocardiography analysis included an off-line analysis of integrated backscatter (IBS). ECG was analysed for fragmented QRS (fQRS). In addition, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging was performed at the six-year control. The left ventricle 16-segment model was used in cardiac imaging, and respective local radiation doses were analysed. Results: Regional myocardial reflectivity in inferoseptal segments increased by 2.02 (4.53) dB (p = 0.026) and the percentage of leads with fQRS increased from 9.2 to 16.4% (p = 0.002) during the follow-up. In CMR imaging, abnormal extracellular volume (ECV) and T1 mapping values were found with anteroseptal and apical localization in a median of 3.5 (1.00–5.75) and 3 (1.25–4.00) segments, respectively. A higher left ventricle radiation dose was associated with an increased likelihood of having changes simultaneously in CMR and echocardiography (OR 1.26, 95% Cl. 1.00–1.59, p = 0.047). Conclusions: After radiotherapy, progressive changes in markers of diffuse myocardial fibrosis were observed in a multimodal manner in ECG and echocardiography. Changes in echocardiography and abnormal values in CMR were localized in the septal and apical regions, and multiple changes were associated with higher radiation doses. © 2023, The Author(s).","Adjuvant Radiotherapy; Breast neoplasms; Cardiac Electrophysiology; Cardiotoxicity; Echocardiography; Endomyocardial Fibrosis; Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging","Breast Neoplasms; Female; Fibrosis; Follow-Up Studies; Heart; Humans; Myocardium; acetylsalicylic acid; angiotensin receptor antagonist; aromatase inhibitor; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; diuretic agent; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; tamoxifen; adult; Article; breast cancer; cancer radiotherapy; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; clinical article; clinical outcome; echocardiography; electrocardiogram; electrocardiography; extracellular space; female; follow up; fragmented QRS; heart left ventricle; heart muscle fibrosis; heart septum; human; hypercholesterolemia; hypertension; multimodal imaging; radiation dose; risk factor; thrombosis; breast tumor; cardiac muscle; diagnostic imaging; fibrosis; follow up; heart; pathology","M.

We aimed to assess whether statins prevent decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in anthracycline-treated patients at increased risk for CTRCD. Methods: In this multicenter double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, patients with cancer at increased risk of anthracycline-related CTRCD (per ASCO guidelines) were randomly assigned to atorvastatin 40 mg or placebo once-daily. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging was performed before and within 4 weeks after anthracyclines. Blood biomarkers were measured at every cycle. The primary outcome was post-anthracycline LVEF, adjusted for baseline. CTRCD was defined as a fall in LVEF by >10% to <53%. Secondary endpoints included left ventricular (LV) volumes, CTRCD, CMR tissue characterization, high sensitivity troponin I (hsTnI), and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Results: We randomized 112 patients (56.9 ± 13.6 years, 87 female, and 73 with breast cancer): 54 to atorvastatin and 58 to placebo. Post-anthracycline CMR was performed 22 (13-27) days from last anthracycline dose. Post-anthracycline LVEF did not differ between the atorvastatin and placebo groups (57.3 ± 5.8% and 55.9 ± 7.4%, respectively) when adjusted for baseline LVEF (P = 0.34). There were no significant between-group differences in post-anthracycline LV end-diastolic (P = 0.20) or end-systolic volume (P = 0.12), CMR myocardial edema and/or fibrosis (P = 0.06-0.47), or peak hsTnI (P ≥ 0.99) and BNP (P = 0.23). CTRCD incidence was similar (4% versus 4%, P ≥ 0.99). There was no difference in adverse events. Conclusions: In patients at increased risk of CTRCD, primary prevention with atorvastatin during anthracycline therapy did not ameliorate early LVEF decline, LV remodeling, CTRCD, change in serum cardiac biomarkers, or CMR myocardial tissue changes.  © 2023 The Author(s).","Anthracycline; Cardiotoxicity; Magnetic resonance imaging; Primary prevention; Statins","Anthracyclines; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; Atorvastatin; Biomarkers; Breast Neoplasms; Cardiotoxicity; Female; Heart Diseases; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Stroke Volume; Ventricular Function, Left; alanine aminotransferase; anthracycline; atorvastatin; brain natriuretic peptide; creatine kinase; creatinine; doxorubicin; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; low density lipoprotein; trastuzumab; troponin; anthracycline; antineoplastic antibiotic; atorvastatin; biological marker; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; adult; Article; breast cancer; cancer patient; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular risk; clinical outcome; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; double blind procedure; drug induced disease; dyslipidemia; European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions questionnaire; female; fibrosis; global longitudinal strain; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle enddiastolic volume; heart left ventricle endsystolic volume; heart left ventricle volume; human; late gadolinium enhancement imaging; leukemia; lymphoma; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multicenter study; primary prevention; randomized controlled trial; rhabdomyolysis; sarcoma; smoking; thymoma; breast tumor; cardiotoxicity; clinical trial; diagnostic imaging; heart disease; heart left ventricle function; heart stroke volume","P.

Our previous work in 46 prospectively enrolled breast cancer patients showed early left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) function decline at 1 and 3 months, but only persistent RV dysfunction at 12 months which correlated with myocardial oedema observed early (1 and 3 months) after administration of chemotherapy regimes. Method: To investigate late cardiac effects, the same cohort were re-imaged with advanced Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging including T1 mapping 5 ± 1 year post chemotherapy. Results: Twenty-six out of 46 (50%) patients underwent follow-up imaging. A statistical but non-clinically significant decrease was observed in LV ejection fraction (EF) from baseline to 5 years (72.2 ± 6.6 to 65.4 ± 9.3, p < 0.005). Subjects with initial drop of LVEF by >10% at 3 months (n = 5) or at 12 months (n = 3) did not demonstrate any difference in LV or RVEF at 5 years. No correlation was observed between myocardial oedema and LV or RVEF at 5 years. At 5 years, T1 values were within normal limits overall (935 ± 48 ms). One patients had significantly elevated (>1000 ms) T1 values with no correlation to LV or RVEF. No subjects demonstrated replacement myocardial fibrosis at 5 years. Conclusion: Using advanced CMR, contemporary chemotherapy regimes demonstrate minimal long-term cardiac toxicity. There is minimal diffuse and no replacement fibrosis as demonstrated by LGE, following chemotherapy. This study suggests limiting serial imaging in these patients at 12 months post chemotherapy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Breast cancer; Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging; Cardiotoxicity; Chemotherapy; Left ventricular ejection fraction; T1-mapping","Adult; Anthracyclines; Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Breast Neoplasms; Cardiotoxicity; Cohort Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Middle Aged; Trastuzumab; Treatment Outcome; Ventricular Dysfunction, Left; anthracycline; trastuzumab; anthracycline; antineoplastic agent; immunological antineoplastic agent; trastuzumab; adult; Article; breast cancer; cancer chemotherapy; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; clinical article; follow up; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart right ventricle ejection fraction; human; priority journal; breast tumor; cardiotoxicity; chemically induced; cine magnetic resonance imaging; cohort analysis; diagnostic imaging; female; heart left ventricle function; middle aged; treatment outcome; trends","J.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have evaluated the effects of beta-blockers (BBs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) on trastuzumab- and anthracycline-associated cardiotoxicity. We report a meta-analysis of these RCTs in patients with breast cancer. Methods and results: The primary analysis was on the effect of BBs and ACEI/ARBs on LVEF in patients treated with either trastuzumab or anthracyclines. A secondary analysis was done investigating the effect of BBs or ACEI/ARBs on LVEF in trastuzumab and anthracycline treatments. Only RCTs were included using the search term 'ARBs, ACEIs, BBs, anthracyclines, trastuzumab, and breast cancer' in PubMed, Embase, and CENTRAL up to 31 March 2021. A meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the mean difference (MD) in LVEF between intervention and placebo groups at follow-up. A total of nine RCTs (n = 1362) were included in the analysis. All patients were women. BBs and ACEI/ARBs were shown to attenuate the decline in LVEF during trastuzumab and anthracycline treatments [MD: 2.4; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.3-4.2 and MD: 1.5; 95% CI: -0.6 to 3.7]. Compared with placebo, LVEF was significantly higher in patients assigned to BB or ACEI/ARB on trastuzumab (MD: 2.3; 95% CI: 0.0-4.6) but not on anthracyclines (MD: 1.9; 95% CI: -0.5 to 4.2). Conclusion: Both BB and ACEI/ARB therapies were associated with the preservation of LVEF during trastuzumab and anthracycline-containing regimens as compared with placebo, suggesting both to be beneficial.  © 2021 Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

Methods and Materials: We enrolled 50 patients with low-risk, hormone-sensitive breast cancer from 2015 to 2018 on a prospective phase 1/2 trial to receive single-fraction, high-gradient partial-breast irradiation (SFHGPBI) 2 to 8 weeks after lumpectomy for node-negative, invasive, or in situ breast cancer. The high gradient was achieved by prescribing 20 Gy to the surgical bed and 5 Gy to the breast tissue within 1 cm of the surgical bed simultaneously in 1 fraction using external beam. Results: The median age was 65 (range, 52-84). Ten patients (20%) had small-volume ductal carcinoma in situ while the remainder had stage I disease. At a median follow-up of 25 months, we evaluated toxicity, patient- and physician-reported cosmesis, patient-reported quality of life (QOL), and initial tumor control. There was no Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 grade 3+ toxicity. Only 34% of patients experienced grade 1 erythema. Good-to-excellent pretreatment cosmesis was present in 100% and 98% per physicians and patients, respectively, and did not change post-SFHGPBI. Quantitative cosmesis by percentage of breast retraction assessment significantly improved over time during the post-SFHGPBI period per mixed repeated measures modeling (P = .0026). QOL per European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QOL Questionnaires C30 and BR-23 did not decline other than temporarily in the systemic therapy effects and hair loss domains, both of which returned to pretreatment values. There was 1 noninvasive in-breast recurrence in a separate untreated quadrant 18 months post-SFHGPBI and 1 isolated axillary recurrence 30 months post-SFHGPBI, both salvaged successfully. There were no distant recurrences or cancer-related deaths observed. Conclusions: Accelerated partial-breast irradiation delivered in a single fraction postoperatively using external beam techniques is a novel, feasible, well-tolerated regimen. SFHGPBI does not adversely affect cosmesis or QOL as reported by both physicians and patients. Initial tumor control rates are excellent, with longer follow-up required to confirm efficacy. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Breast Neoplasms; Dose Fractionation, Radiation; Feasibility Studies; Female; Hormones; Humans; Mastectomy, Segmental; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Postoperative Period; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Radiotherapy, Adjuvant; Safety; Diseases; Irradiation; Surgery; Surveys; Toxicity; Tumors; cyclophosphamide; docetaxel; hormone; Accelerated partial breast irradiation; Breast retraction assessments; Common terminology criteria; Ductal carcinoma in situ; Methods and materials; Partial breast irradiation; Repeated measures; Systemic therapy; accelerated partial breast irradiation; adult; adverse event; aged; arthralgia; Article; breast cancer; breast carcinoma; breast carcinoma in situ; breast tissue; cancer chemotherapy; cancer control; cancer hormone therapy; cancer staging; cardiotoxicity; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; erythema; female; follow up; hot flush; human; hyperpigmentation; intensity modulated radiation therapy; intraductal carcinoma; invasive carcinoma; lumpectomy; lung toxicity; mastalgia; nipple malformation; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; planning target volume; postmenopause; priority journal; quality of life; radiation dose fractionation; soft tissue fibrosis; thorax pain; thromboembolism; adjuvant radiotherapy; breast tumor; clinical trial; feasibility study; middle aged; partial mastectomy; pathology; phase 1 clinical trial; phase 2 clinical trial; postoperative period; prospective study; safety; very elderly; Quality control","I.

Despite the improvement in outcomes of those patients, the risk of treatment-related cardiotoxicity remains high, and its presence has been associated with a higher risk of treatment termination and thus lower therapeutic efficacy. Prior trials demonstrated that a preventive initiation of heart failure drugs, including the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone inhibitors, might reduce the risk of treatment-related cardiotoxicity. However, to date, no study investigated the efficacy of sacubitril/valsartan, a novel antineurohormonal drug shown to be superior to the previous therapies, in the prevention of cardiotoxicity in patients with early-stage breast cancer, which is the aim of the trial. Methods and results: MAINSTREAM is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicentre, clinical trial. After the run-in period, a total of 480 patients with early breast cancer undergoing treatment with anthracyclines and/or anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 drugs will be randomized to the highest tolerated dose of sacubitril/valsartan, being preferably 97/103 mg twice daily or placebo in 1:1 ratio. The patients will be monitored, including routine transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and laboratory biomarker monitoring, for 24 months. The primary endpoint of the trial will be the occurrence of a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction by ≥5% in TTE within 24 months. The key secondary endpoints will be the composite endpoint of death from any cause or hospitalization for heart failure, as well as other imaging, laboratory, and clinical outcomes, including the occurrence of the cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction resulting in the necessity to initiate treatment. The first patients are expected to be recruited in the coming months, and the estimated completion of the study and publication of the results are expected in December 2027, pending recruitment. Conclusions: The MAINSTREAM trial will determine the efficacy and safety of treatment with sacubitril/valsartan as a prevention of cardiotoxicity in patients with early breast cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT05465031). © 2023 The Authors.

We sought to determine whether changes in VO2peak and cardiac function persisted at 12 months post-AC completion, and whether changes in cardiac function explain the heightened long-term heart failure risk. Methods Women with breast cancer scheduled for AC (n = 28) who participated in a nonrandomized trial of exercise training (ET; n = 14) or usual care (UC; n = 14) during AC completed a follow-up evaluation 12 months post-AC completion (16 months from baseline). At baseline, 4 months, and 16 months, participants underwent a resting echocardiogram (left ventricular ejection fraction; global longitudinal strain), a blood sample (troponin; B-type natriuretic peptide), a cardiopulmonary exercise test, and cardiac MRI measures of stroke volume (SV), heart rate, and cardiac output (Qc) at rest and during intense exercise. Results Seventeen women (UC, n = 8; ET, n = 9) completed evaluation at baseline, 4 months, and 16 months. At 4 months, AC was associated with 18% and 6% reductions in VO2peak in the UC and ET groups, respectively, which persisted at 16 months (UC, -16%; ET, -7%) and was not attenuated by ET (interaction, P = 0.10). Exercise Qc was lower at 16 months compared with baseline and 4 months (P < 0.001), which was due to a blunted augmentation of SV during exercise (P = 0.032; a 14% reduction in peak SV), with no changes in heart rate response. There was a small reduction in resting left ventricular ejection fraction (baseline to 4 months) and global longitudinal strain (between 4 and 16 months) and an increase in troponin (baseline to 4 months), but only exercise Qc was associated with VO2peak (R2 = 0.47, P < 0.01). Conclusion Marked reductions in VO2peak persisted 12 months after anthracycline-based chemotherapy, which was associated with impaired exercise cardiac function.

Methods: HER2-positive breast cancer patients undergoing planned anti-HER2 therapy and nonanthracycline-based chemotherapy were enrolled and subdivided into dual anti-HER2 (trastuzumab plus pertuzumab) group and trastuzumab group. Cardiac MRI was performed before treatment and three months after starting, covering ventricular volumes, cardiac function, systolic myocardial strain, myocardial oedema, and T1 and T2 relaxation times. Cardiac dysfunction was primarily defined as a > 10% reduction in LV ejection fraction (LVEF) to < 55% and/or a > 15% global longitudinal strain (GLS) change at the follow-up MRI examination. Results: Twenty-four HER2-positive patients were evaluated (16 in the dual anti-HER2 group, 8 in the trastuzumab group). Six patients developed cardiac dysfunction at follow-up, five of them in the dual anti-HER2 group. One patient developed symptomatic heart failure, and five patients developed asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction. Patients displayed significantly decreased systolic function and increased T1 and T2 relaxation time at follow-up (p ≤ 0.031). Systolic dysfunction remained significant in the dual anti-HER2 group. The decrease in GLS in the trastuzumab group was not significant (p = 0.169). T1 and T2 relaxation times tended to increase, but this was not significant at subgroup analysis. Conclusions: Cardiac MRI scans showed frequent signs of subclinical cardiotoxicity after short-term anti-HER2 therapy and nonanthracycline-based chemotherapy; the effect was slightly stronger in patients treated with dual therapy. Key points: • A frequent subclinical cardiotoxicity was detected by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging after short-term anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) therapy. • The change in myocardial strain was more marked in patients treated with dual (trastuzumab plus pertuzumab) than with trastuzumab only anti-HER2 therapy. • Cardiotoxicity surveillance through MRI is an interesting option particularly in patients treated with dual anti-HER2 therapy. © 2023, The Author(s).","Breast neoplasms; Cardiotoxicity; Magnetic resonance imaging; Pertuzumab; Trastuzumab","Breast Neoplasms; Cardiotoxicity; Female; Heart Diseases; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Trastuzumab; carboplatin; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; pertuzumab; trastuzumab; trastuzumab; adult; Article; body surface; breast cancer; breast tumor; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular parameters; cardiovascular risk; clinical article; controlled study; female; follow up; global longitudinal strain; heart function; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle enddiastolic volume; heart left ventricle mass; heart stroke volume; human; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive breast cancer; hypertension; interrater reliability; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; obesity; risk factor; breast tumor; cardiotoxicity; diagnostic imaging; heart disease; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging","J.

The prevalence ranges from 0% to 30% and the patterns are ill-defined. Whether treatment with anthracyclines and/or trastuzumab is associated with LGE is unclear. We aimed to investigate these topics in a large cohort of consecutive cancer patients with suspected cardiotoxicity from anthracyclines and/or trastuzumab. Methods and results: We studied 298 patients, analysed the prevalence, patterns, and correlates of LGE, and determined their causes. We compared the findings with those from 100 age-matched cancer patients who received neither anthracyclines nor trastuzumab. Amongst those who received anthracyclines and/or trastuzumab, 31 (10.4%) had LGE. It had a wide range of extent (3.9-34.7%) and locations. An ischaemic pattern was present in 20/31 (64.5%) patients. There was an alternative explanation for the non-ischaemic LGE in 7/11 (63.6%) patients. In the age-matched patients who received neither anthracyclines nor trastuzumab, the prevalence of LGE was higher at 27.0%, while the extent of LGE and the proportion with ischaemic pattern were not different. Conclusion: LGE was present in only a minority. Its patterns and locations did not fit into a single unique profile. It had alternative explanations in virtually all cases. Finally, LGE was also present in cancer patients who received neither anthracyclines nor trastuzumab. Therefore, treatment with anthracyclines and/or trastuzumab is unlikely to be associated with LGE. The absence of LGE can help distinguish anthracycline-and/or trastuzumab-related cardiomyopathy from unrelated cardiomyopathies.  © 2020 Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

The cardiotoxic effects of these treatments, however, may offset some of the survival benefit. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is an emerging modality to assess cardiac injury. This is a pilot trial assessing cardiac damage using CMR in patients who received anthracycline-based chemotherapy and three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) regional nodal irradiation using heart constraints. Materials and Methods: Node-positive breast cancer patients (2000–2008) treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy and 3DCRT regional nodal irradiation (including the internal mammary chain nodes) with heart ventricular constraints (V25 < 10%) were invited to participate. Cardiac tissues were contoured and analyzed separately for whole heart (pericardium) and for combined ventricles and left atrium (myocardium). CMR obtained ventricular function/dimensions, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), global longitudinal strain (GLS), and extracellular volume fraction (ECV) as measures of cardiac injury and/or early fibrosis. CMR parameters were correlated with dose-volume constraints using Spearman correlations. Results: Fifteen left-sided and five right-sided patients underwent CMR. Median diagnosis age was 50 (32–77). No patients had baseline cardiac disease before regional nodal irradiation. Median time after 3DCRT was 8.3 years (5.2–14.4). Median left-sided mean heart dose (MHD) was 4.8 Gy (1.1–11.2) and V25 was 5.7% (0–12%). Median left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 63%. No abnormal LGE was observed. No correlations were seen between whole heart doses and LVEF, LV mass, GLS, or LV dimensions. Increasing ECV did not correlate with increased heart or ventricular doses. However, correlations between higher LV mass and ventricular mean dose, V10, and V25 were seen. Conclusion: At a median follow-up of 8.3 years, this cohort of node-positive breast cancer patients who received anthracycline-based chemotherapy and regional nodal irradiation had no clinically abnormal CMR findings. However, correlations between ventricular mean dose, V10, and V25 and LV mass were seen. Larger corroborating studies that include advanced techniques for measuring regional heart mechanics are warranted. © Copyright © 2020 Bergom, Rubenstein, Wilson, Welsh, Ibrahim, Prior, Schottstaedt, Eastwood, Zhang, Currey, Puckett, Strande, Bradley and White.","3D conformal radiation therapy; breast cancer; cardiac MRI; cardiotoxicity; radiation therapy","anthracycline; cardiotoxin; gadolinium; trastuzumab; adult; aged; aortic regurgitation; Article; breast cancer; cancer chemotherapy; cancer survivor; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; cardiovascular parameters; clinical article; conformal radiotherapy; end diastolic volume index; extracellular volume fraction; female; follow up; geometry; global longitudinal strain; heart function; heart injury; heart left atrium; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle mass; heart muscle fibrosis; heart tissue; heart ventricle size; human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pericardium; pilot study; radiation dose; risk factor","C.

However, the changes in myocardial tissue characterization with radiation-induced cardiotoxicity are not well-understood. Objectives: This study sought to assess the changes in left ventricular function and tissue characterization using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in patients receiving RT. Materials and Methods: Between June 2015 and July 2018, we enrolled patients with breast, lung cancer, or lymphoma with plan to receive chest radiation after chemotherapy. CMR was performed using a 1.5T scanner at baseline and 6 months after RT. Myocardial volume, function, strain analysis using feature tracking, and tissue characterization including late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), T1, T2, T1ρ (rho), and extracellular volume fraction (ECV) were measured and compared using non-parametric methods. Results: The final cohort consisted of 16 patients, 11 of whom completed both baseline and follow-up CMRs. Patients were matched to 10 healthy controls. At baseline prior to RT, compared to controls, patients had lower global circumferential strain (GCS) (15.3 ± 2.2% vs.18.4 ± 2.1%, p = 0.004), and elevated T2 (47.9 ± 4.8 ms vs. 45.0 ± 1.5 ms, p = 0.04) and T1ρ values (78.4 ± 5.9 vs. 66.9 ± 4.6 ms, p < 0.001). Two patients had LGE. There was no significant difference in the average T1 values or ECV. There was a trend toward lower LV ejection fraction and global longitudinal strain (GLS). At 6-month follow-up after RT, there were no significant changes in all the CMR parameters. Conclusion: At 6-month following chest radiation therapy, there was no change in LV and RV EF, LV and RV GLS, LV GCS, and myocardial tissue characterization using LGE, T1, ECV, T2, and T1ρ in a small cohort of patients. However, the baseline T2 and T1ρ were elevated and LV GCS was reduced compared to controls indicating ongoing myocardial edema and subclinical dysfunction post-chemotherapy.

Cardio-oncology (CO) services have been developed to solve this issue. The outcomes regarding patient demographics and clinical findings are limited and the available data include CO services evaluating patients undergoing only chemotherapy as opposed to those also undergoing radiation therapy. aims We aimed to show initial experiences of the CO service implemented in a tertiary oncology center. methods The CO service was designed to include 2 major domains, general CO and electrotherapy consultations. This observational study included patients referred to the CO service with the following data: baseline demographics, cancer type, reasons for referral, cardiac evaluation, and initial clinical outcomes. results All patients with cancer referred to our CO service between March 2016 and December 2019 were included in the study. A total of 2762 patients (77% women) at the mean (SD) age of 62 (12) years were referred (63% on an out-patient basis) for general consultations. The most frequent diagnosis was breast cancer (66%). A total of 18% of patients were referred to the CO service due to cardiovascular complications related to cancer treatment. The CO–cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) team evaluated 652 patients (515 patients with CIEDs who were qualified for radiotherapy, 48 patients with CIEDs who were assessed with magnetic resonance imaging, and 89 patients with CIEDs who underwent cancer surgery). In the total of 5872 radiotherapy sessions, there were 2 harmful interactions; no other complications during magnetic resonance imaging and surgery were recorded. conclusions The CO-service established within the cancer center seems to be safe and feasible.

Methods: This retrospective study included the patients with HER2+ early-stage breast cancer who received NACT with the regimen TCbHP or AC-THP and then underwent surgery from 2019 to 2022. pCR rate and breast-conserving rate were calculated to evaluate the efficacy of the regimens. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from echocardiograms and abnormal electrocardiographs (ECGs) were collected to evaluate the cardiotoxicity of the two regimens. Association between the characteristics of the breast cancer lesions by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the pCR rate were also explored. Results: A total of 159 patients were enrolled, including 48 patients in the AC-THP group and 111 patients in the TCbHP group. The pCR rate of the TCbHP group 64.0% (71/111) was significantly higher than that of for the the AC-THP group 37.5% (18/48) (P=0.002). Estrogen receptor (ER) status (P=0.011, OR: 0.437, 95% CI: 0.231-0.829), progesterone receptor (PR) status (P=0.001, OR: 0.309, 95% CI: 0.157-0.608) and IHC HER2 status (P=0.003, OR: 7.167, 95% CI: 1.970-26.076) were significantly correlated with the pCR rate. LVEF decreased at 6 and 12 months after treatment in the AC-THP group (P=0.024 and 0.040), which only decreased after 6 months of treatment in the TCbHP group (P=0.048). Post-NACT MRI characteristics including mass features (P<0.001) and enhancement type (P<0.001) were significantly associated with pCR rate. Conclusions: Early-stage HER2+ breast cancer treated with the TCbHP regimen has a higher pCR rate than the AC-THP group. The TCbHP regimen appears to have lower cardiotoxicity than the AC-THP regimen in terms of LVEF.

To date, emphasis has been placed on how cancer therapeutics influence downstream cardiac health. However, whether active malignancy itself influences chamber volumes, function, or overall myocardial tissue health remains uncertain. We sought to perform a comprehensive cardiovascular magnetic resonance-based evaluation of cardiac health in patients with chemotherapy-naïve cancer with comparison with a healthy volunteer population. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three-hundred and eighty-one patients with active breast cancer or lymphoma before cardiotoxic chemotherapy exposure were recruited in addition to 102 healthy volunteers. Both cohorts underwent standardized cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging with quantification of chamber volumes, ejection fraction, and native myocardial T1. Left ventricular mechanics were incrementally assessed using three-dimensional myocardial deformation analysis, providing global longitudinal, circumferential, radial, and principal peak-systolic strain amplitude and systolic strain rate. The mean age of patients with cancer was 53.8±13.4 years; 79% being women. Despite similar left ventricular ejection fraction, patients with cancer showed smaller chambers, increased strain amplitude, and systolic strain rate in both conventional and principal directions, and elevated native T1 versus sex-matched healthy volunteers. Adjusting for age, sex, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, the presence of cancer remained associated with these cardiovascular magnetic resonance parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of cancer is independently associated with alterations in cardiac chamber size, function, and objective markers of tissue health. Dedicated research is warranted to elucidate pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying these findings and to explore their relevance to the management of patients with cancer referred for cardiotoxic therapies. © 2021 The Authors.

Materials and Methods: A total of 145 patients (male:female = 76:69, mean age = 63.0 years) with cancer and heart failure who underwent CMR between January 2015 and January 2021 were included. CMR was performed using a 3T scanner (Siemens). Biventricular functions, native T1 T2, extracellular volume fraction (ECV) values, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) of the left ventricle (LV) were compared between those with and without CTRCD. These were compared between patients with mild-to-moderate CTRCD and those with severe CTRCD. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between the CMR parameters and MACE occurrence during follow-up in the CTRCD patients. Results: Among 145 patients, 61 had CTRCD and 84 did not have CTRCD. Native T1, ECV, and T2 were significantly higher in the CTRCD group (1336.9 ms, 32.5%, and 44.7 ms, respectively) than those in the non-CTRCD group (1303.4 ms, 30.5%, and 42.0 ms, respectively; P = 0.013, 0.010, and < 0.001, respectively). They were not significantly different between patients with mild-to-moderate and severe CTRCD. Indexed LV mass was significantly smaller in the CTRCD group (65.0 g/m2 vs. 78.9 g/m2; P < 0.001). According to the multivariable Cox regression analysis, T2 (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01–1.27; P = 0.028) and quantified LGE (HR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.01–1.13; P = 0.021) were independently associated with MACE in the CTRCD patients. Conclusion: Quantitative parameters from CMR have the potential to evaluate myocardial changes in CTRCD. Increased T2 with reduced LV mass was demonstrated in CTRCD patients even before the development of severe cardiac dysfunction. T2 and quantified LGE may be independent prognostic factors for MACE in patients with CTRCD. © 2023 The Korean Society of Radiology.","Cardiotoxicity; Late gadolinium enhancement; Magnetic resonance imaging; T1 mapping; T2 mapping","Contrast Media; Female; Gadolinium; Heart Failure; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; anthracycline; brain natriuretic peptide; gadolinium; gadoterate meglumine; contrast medium; adult; aged; Article; breast cancer; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; diabetes mellitus; echocardiography; female; head and neck cancer; heart failure; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart transplantation; heart ventricle fibrillation; heart ventricle tachycardia; hospitalization; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; lymphoma; major adverse cardiac event; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; quantitative analysis; retrospective study; urogenital tract cancer; middle aged; prognosis","Y.J.

Phase II trials have suggested interest in a 2-weekly regimen. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of these two schedules. Methods: Data from MBC patients treated with PLD between 2011 and 2021 were retrospectively collected. The objective was to demonstrate the noninferiority of the 2-weekly versus the 4-weekly schedule in terms of 6-month progression-free survival (PFS). The prespecified noninferiority margin was calculated as 1.20. A propensity score to receive either schedule was estimated using a gradient boosting algorithm. Survival analyses using Cox regression models weighted by the propensity score were performed to compare the schedules. Results: Among the 192 patients included, 96 (50%) underwent each schedule. The median number of previous systemic therapies was 4 (IQR, 3 to 6). Anthracyclines were previously given in early breast cancer in 63.9% of patients. The median follow-up was 10.0 months (IQR, 5.0 to 20.1). A comparable distribution of adverse events was observed. The median PFS was 3.2 months (95% CI, 2.9 to 3.9), and the median overall survival was 12.1 months (95% CI, 10.8 to 14.9). The weighted hazard ratio for PFS was 1.12 (90% CI, 0.82 to 1.54), including the noninferiority boundaries. Conclusion: PLD appeared to be a well-tolerated drug in this heavily pretreated MBC population. The efficacy and safety of the 2-weekly schedule did not provide any advantage, suggesting no interest in changing the registered regimen. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Anthracyclines; Metastatic breast cancer; Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin; Propensity score; Schedule","Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Breast Neoplasms; Doxorubicin; Female; Humans; Polyethylene Glycols; Propensity Score; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; anthracycline; doxorubicin; epirubicin; antineoplastic agent; antineoplastic antibiotic; doxorubicin; macrogol; adult; aged; allergy; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cardiotoxicity; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; confidence interval; dosage schedule comparison; dose calculation algorithm; drug dose reduction; drug withdrawal; erythroderma; female; follow up; hazard ratio; human; hyperpigmentation; major clinical study; metastatic breast cancer; non-inferiority trial; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; overall survival; patient safety; phase 2 clinical trial; positron emission tomography; progression free survival; propensity score; proportional hazards model; rash; retrospective study; statistical distribution; stomatitis; systemic therapy; breast tumor; pathology; propensity score; treatment outcome","H.

Objectives: We hypothesized that cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) would identify structural and functional myocardial abnormalities in anthracycline-treated cancer survivors with normal LVEF, compared to a matched control population. Methods: Forty-five cancer survivors (56 ± 16 yrs., 60% female) with normal LVEF (59.5 ± 4.1%) were studied a median of 11 months (range 3–36) following administration of 237 ± 83 mg/m2 anthracycline, and compared with forty-five healthy control subjects of similar age and sex (53 ± 16 yrs., 60% female) with normal LVEF (60.8 ± 2.4%) using 1.5 T CMR. Results: Significantly smaller indexed left ventricular mass (45.6 ± 8.7 vs 50.3 ± 10.1 g/m2, p = 0.02) and indexed myocardial cell volume (30.5 ± 5.7 vs 34.8 ± 7.2 ml/m2, p = 0.002) were evident in cancer survivors and the latter was inversely associated with cumulative anthracycline dose (r = −0.31, p = 0.02). Surrogate CMR markers of myocardial fibrosis were significantly increased in cancer survivors (native myocardial T1: 1021 ± 40 vs 996 ± 35 ms, p = 0.002; extracellular volume: 29.5 ± 4.5 vs 27.4 ± 2.3%, p = 0.006). CMR-derived feature-tracking global longitudinal strain (GLS) was significantly impaired in cancer survivors (2D GLS -18.3 ± 2.6 vs −20.0 ± 2.0%, p < 0.001; 3D GLS -14.5 ± 2.3 vs −16.4 ± 2.6%, p < 0.001). Parameters exhibited good to excellent (ICC = 0.86–0.98) inter- and intra-observer reproducibility. Conclusions: Anthracycline-treated cancer survivors with normal LVEF have significant perturbations of LV mass, myocardial cell volume, native myocardial T1, ECV, CMR-derived 2D and 3D GLS, compared to controls, with good to excellent levels of inter- and intra-observer reproducibility. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","anthracycline; Cardio-oncology; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; tissue characterisation","Adult; Anthracyclines; Cardiotoxicity; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Male; Myocytes, Cardiac; Predictive Value of Tests; Reproducibility of Results; Stroke Volume; Ventricular Function, Left; anthracycline derivative; doxorubicin; anthracycline; adult; Article; breast cancer; cancer survivor; cardiac muscle cell; cardiomyopathy; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; cell volume; clinical article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; disease marker; extracellular space; female; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle mass; heart muscle fibrosis; hematologic malignancy; human; interrater reliability; intrarater reliability; male; malignant neoplasm; middle aged; cardiotoxicity; cine magnetic resonance imaging; diagnostic imaging; heart left ventricle function; heart stroke volume; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; predictive value; reproducibility","C.

Traditional open surgery has a large amount of bleeding, which is not suitable for patients with acute pelvic fracture. Navigationguided, percutaneous puncture-screw implantation has gradually become a preferred procedure due to its advantages, which include less trauma, faster recovery times, and less bleeding. However, due to the complexity of pelvic anatomy, doctors often encounter some problems when using navigation to treat pelvic fractures. This article reviews the indications, contraindications, surgical procedures, and related complications of this procedure for the treatment of sacral fractures, sacroiliac joint injuries, pelvic ring injuries, and acetabular fractures. We also analyze the causes of inaccurate screw placement. Percutaneous screw placement under navigational guidance has the advantages of high accuracy, low incidence of complications and small soft-tissue damage, minimal blood loss, short hospital stays, and quick recovery. There is no difference in the incidence of complications between surgeries performed by new doctors and experienced ones. However, computer navigation technology requires extensive training, and attention should be given to avoid complications such as screw misplacement, intestinal injury, and serious blood vessel and nerve injuries caused by navigational drift. © The Author(s) 2020.","Acetabular fracture; Computer navigation; Iliac fracture; Pelvic fracture; Percutaneous puncture; Pubic fracture; Sacral fracture; Screw","acetabulum fracture; angiomyolipoma; Article; blood transfusion; bone density; bone radiography; breast cancer; cardiotoxicity; computer assisted tomography; echocardiography; endometrioid carcinoma; fracture fixation; human; laparoscopic surgery; lung hemorrhage; minimally invasive surgery; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; operation duration; osteoporosis; pelvis fracture; pneumothorax; postoperative complication; posttraumatic arthropathy; randomized controlled trial (topic); rectum injury; retrospective study; risk factor; robot assisted surgery; sacroiliac joint; scoliosis; Shy Drager syndrome; spine fracture; spine malformation; systemic lupus erythematosus; thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; Waldenstroem macroglobulinemia","J.-W.

Methods: In 2022, a nationwide survey was conducted among board-certified radiation oncologists. The survey consisted of 44 questions related to six domains: hypofractionated (HypoFx) whole breast RT, accelerated partial breast RT (APBI), regional nodal irradiation (RNI), RT for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), postmastectomy RT (PMRT), and tumor bed boost. Results: Seventy radiation oncologists from 61 (out of 101; 60%) institutions participated in the survey. HypoFx RT was used by 62 respondents (89%), a significant increase from 36% in 2017. HypoFx RT is commonly administered at 40–42.5 Gy in 15–16 fractions. APBI was used by 12 respondents (17%), an increase from 5% in 2017. The use of RNI did not change significantly: ≥ pN2 (6%), ≥ pN1 (33%), and ≥ pN1 with pathological risk factors (61%). However, indications for internal mammary lymph node (IMN) irradiation have expanded. In particular, the rates of routine treatment of IMN (11% from 6% in 2017) and treatment in cases of ≥ pN2 (27% from 14% in 2017) have doubled; however, the rate of treatment for only IMN involvement, identified on imaging, has decreased from 47% in 2017 to 31%. For DCIS, the use of HypoFx RT increased from 25% in 2017 to 75%, and the rate of RT omissions after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) decreased from 48% in 2017 to 38%. The use of HypoFx RT for PMRT increased from 8% in 2017 to 36%. Conclusion: The adoption of HypoFx RT after BCS for invasive breast cancer and DCIS has increased significantly, whereas the use of HypoFx PMRT has increased moderately since 2017. However, further studies are required to determine the optimal use of RNI. © 2023 Korean Breast Cancer Society.","Breast Neoplasms; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Radiotherapy; Republic of Korea; Surveys and Questionnaires","accelerated partial breast irradiation; accelerated partial breast radiotherapy; Article; axillary lymph node; breast cancer; breast tumor; breast-conserving surgery; cancer radiotherapy; cardiac sparing radiotherapy; cardiotoxicity; clinical feature; clinical practice; computer assisted tomography; decision making; ductal breast carcinoma in situ; health survey; heart block; histology; human; hypofractionated radiotherapy; imaging; intensity modulated radiation therapy; internal mammary lymph node; irradiation; lymph node dissection; lymph node irradiation; lymphovascular space invasion; mastectomy; neoadjuvant chemotherapy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physician; questionnaire; radiation dose; radiation dose fractionation; radiation oncologist; radiation oncology; regional nodal irradiation; risk factor; scar; sentinel lymph node biopsy; shared decision making; South Korea; surgical margin; tumor bed boost; tumor invasion; tumor volume; volumetric modulated arc therapy; whole brain radiotherapy","K.

We intended to assess the early cardiotoxic effects of doxorubicin utilizing cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. Material and Methods: Forty-nine patients including 21 otherwise healthy females with BC at a mean age (±SD) of 47.62 ± 9.07 years and 28 normal controls at a mean age (±SD) of 45.18 ± 4.29 years were recruited. They underwent CMR and transthoracic echocardiography at baseline and 7 days after four biweekly cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Biventricular functional, volumetric, global strain, and tissue characterization findings were analyzed and compared with those of 28 controls. Results: In post-chemotherapy CMR, 4 patients (19.04%), three symptomatic and one asymptomatic, exhibited evidence of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. Significant differences in biventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular end-systolic volume index, and all 3D global strain values were noted after chemotherapy in comparison with the baseline (all P < 0.05). More than half of the study population showed a significant change in all right ventricular global strain values. One patient (4.76%) exhibited evidence of diffuse myocardial edema in post-chemotherapy CMR, and 3 patients (14.28%) showed myocardial fibrosis. The study participants were clinically followed up for 4-10 months (mean = 7 months). Overall, 8 patients (38.09%) complained of dyspnea on exertion and fatigue on follow-up. None of the CMR markers was associated with the development of symptoms. Conclusion: Our investigation revealed striking changes in CMR parameters in the follow-up of BC patients treated with cardiotoxic chemotherapy. These exclusive CMR features assist in the early initiation of preventive cardiac strategies. © 2021 Published by Scientific Scholar on behalf of Journal of Clinical Imaging Science","Breast cancer; Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging; Cardiotoxicity; Doxorubicin","cyclophosphamide; doxorubicin; gadolinium; gadoterate meglumine; paclitaxel; adjuvant chemotherapy; adult; Article; asymptomatic disease; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; clinical article; clinical assessment; clinical evaluation; comparative study; controlled study; ductal carcinoma; dyspnea; exertional dyspnea; fatigue; feature detection; female; follow up; heart cycle; heart edema; heart ejection fraction; heart left ventricle endsystolic volume; heart muscle fibrosis; human; human tissue; lobular carcinoma; middle aged; morning dosage; multiple cycle treatment; population; prospective study; symptom; tissue characterization; transthoracic echocardiography; volumetry","N.

This study tested the hypothesis that IP fat may be associated with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decline among cancer patients receiving potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy. Methods: In this prospective study of 61 cancer patients (23 breast cancer, 32 lymphoma, and 6 sarcoma), IP fat and other assessments of body composition, and changes in LVEF from pre- to postcancer treatment using noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging was ascertained. Results: After accounting for age, baseline LVEF, and confounding variables, pre- to 24-month post-treatment LVEF changes were inversely correlated with IP fat (r = −0.33; p = 0.02) and positively correlated with measures of subcutaneous (SQ) fat (r = 0.33; p = 0.01). These LVEF changes were not correlated with BMI (r = 0.12; p = 0.37). Conclusion: Among patients receiving potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy, pretreatment IP fat was associated with subsequent declines in LVEF. There was no association between BMI and LVEF decline. These findings may be related to a potential protective effect of SQ fat. © 2020 The Authors.

This limitation may be overcome by assessment of myocardial work (MW), which incorporates blood pressure into the calculation. Objectives: This work aims to determine whether myocardial work indices (MWIs) can help diagnose or prognosticate CTRCD. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, 136 women undergoing anthracycline and trastuzumab treatment for HER2+ breast cancer, underwent serial echocardiograms and cardiac magnetic resonance pre- and post-anthracycline and every 3 months during trastuzumab. GLS, global work index (GWI), global constructive work (GCW), global wasted work, and global work efficiency were measured. CTRCD was defined with cardiac magnetic resonance. Generalized estimating equations quantified the association between changes in GLS and MWIs and CTRCD at the current (diagnosis) and subsequent visit (prognosis). Regression tree analysis was used to explore the combined use of GLS and MW for the diagnostic/prognostic assessment of CTRCD. Results: Baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 63.2 ± 4.0%. Thirty-seven (27.2%) patients developed CTRCD. An absolute change in GLS (standardized odds ratio [sOR]: 1.97 [95% CI: 1.07-3.66]; P = 0.031) and GWI (sOR: 1.73 [95% CI: 1.04-2.85]; P = 0.033) were associated with concurrent CTRCD. An absolute change in GLS (sOR: 1.79 [95% CI: 1.22-2.62]; P = 0.003), GWI (sOR: 1.67 [95% CI: 1.20-2.32]; P = 0.003), and GCW (sOR: 1.65 [95% CI: 1.17-2.34]; P = 0.005) were associated with subsequent CTRCD. Change in GWI and GCW demonstrated incremental value over GLS and clinical factors for the diagnosis of concurrent CTRCD. In a small group with a GLS change <3.3% (absolute), and a >21 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure, worsening of GWI identified patients with higher probability of concurrent CTRCD (24.0% vs 5.2%). MWIs did not improve identification of subsequent CTRCD beyond knowledge of GLS change. Conclusions: GLS can be used to diagnose and prognosticate cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) defined CTRCD, with additional value from MWIs in selected cases.

Although many therapeutic approaches are available, systemic chemotherapy remains the primary choice, especially for triple-negative and advanced breast cancers. Unfortunately, systemic chemotherapy causes serious side effects and requires high doses to achieve an effective concentration in the tumor. Thus, the use of nanosystems for drug delivery may overcome these limitations. Herein, we formulated Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PLGA-NPs) containing Docetaxel, a fluorescent probe, and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) probe. The cyclic RGD tripeptide was linked to the PLGA surface to actively target αvβ3 integrins, which are overexpressed in breast cancer. PLGA-NPs were characterized using dynamic light scattering, fast field-cycling 1H-relaxometry, and 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance. Their therapeutic effects were assessed both in vitro in triple-negative and HER2+ breast cancer cells, and in vivo in murine models. In vivo MRI and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry of excised tumors revealed a stronger accumulation of PLGA-NPs in the RGD_PLGA group. Targeted PLGAs have improved therapeutic efficacy and strongly reduced cardiac side effects compared to free Docetaxel. In conclusion, RGD-PLGA is a promising system for breast cancer treatment, with positive outcome in terms of therapeutic efficiency and reduction in side effects. © 2022 by the authors.","breast cancer; Docetaxel; magnetic resonance imaging; PLGA nanoparticles; RGD; theranostic","arginylglycylaspartic acid; docetaxel; fluorescent dye; gadolinium; nanocarrier; poly (lactic co glycolic acid) nanoparticle; polyglactin; polymer nanoparticle; unclassified drug; vitronectin receptor; 4T1 cell line; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; Article; breast cancer; breast cancer cell line; cancer chemotherapy; cardiotoxicity; chemical structure; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug efficacy; drug formulation; drug targeting; fast field cycling proton relaxometry; female; gene overexpression; heart protection; human; human cell; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive breast cancer; in vitro study; in vivo study; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; mouse; nanoencapsulation; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; photon correlation spectroscopy; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; theranostic nanomedicine; triple negative breast cancer","E.

However, breast cancer radiotherapy can lead to incidental irradiation of the heart, resulting in an increased risk for a variety of heart diseases arising many years after radiotherapy. Therefore, identifying breast cancer patients at the highest risk for radiation-induced cardiac complications is crucial for developing strategies for primary and secondary prevention, which may contribute to healthy aging. There is still a need for precise knowledge on the relationship between radiation dose to specific cardiac structures and early subclinical cardiac changes and their occurrence over time that could finally lead to cardiac complications. Objective: The MEDIRAD EARLY HEART study aims to identify and validate new cardiac imaging and circulating biomarkers of radiation-induced cardiovascular changes arising within first 2 years of breast cancer radiotherapy and to develop risk models integrating these biomarkers combined with precise dose metrics of cardiac structures based on three-dimensional dosimetry. Methods: The EARLY HEART study is a multicenter, prospective cohort study in which 250 women treated for breast cancer and followed for 2 years after radiotherapy will be included. Women treated with radiotherapy without chemotherapy for a unilateral breast cancer and aged 40-75 years meet the inclusion criteria. Baseline and follow-up data include cardiac measurements based on two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography, computed tomography coronary angiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and a wide panel of circulating biomarkers of cardiac injury. The absorbed dose will be evaluated globally for the heart and different substructures. Furthermore, the dose-response relationship will allow modeling the radiation-induced occurrence and evolution of subclinical cardiac lesions and biomarkers to develop prediction models. Results: This study details the protocol of the MEDIRAD EARLY HEART study and presents the main limits and advantages of this international project. The inclusion of patients began in 2017. Preliminary results are expected to be published in 2019, and complete analysis should be published in 2021. Conclusions: The MEDIRAD EARLY HEART study will allow identifying the main cardiac imaging and blood-based determinants of radiation-induced cardiac injuries to better propose primary and secondary preventive measures in order to contribute to enhanced patient care and quality of life. © Valentin Walker, Anne Crijns, Johannes Langendijk, Daan Spoor, Rozemarijn Vliegenthart, Stephanie E Combs, Michael Mayinger, Arantxa Eraso, Ferran Guedea, Manuela Fiuza, Susana Constantino, Radia Tamarat, Dominique Laurier, Jean Ferrières, Elie Mousseaux, Elisabeth Cardis, Sophie Jacob.","Biomarkers; Breast cancer; Cardiac diagnostic imaging; Cardiotoxicity; Radiation dosimetry; Radiotherapy","","S.

This prospective longitudinal two-centre cohort study recruited HER2+ breast cancer patients between January 2010 and December 2013. MUGA, CMR, NT-BNP and troponin-I were performed at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months after trastuzumab initiation. In total, 41 patients (age 51.7 ± 10.8 years) were enrolled. LVEF comparison between MUGA and CMR demonstrated weak agreement (Lin’s correlation coefficient r = 0.46, baseline; r = 0.29, 6 months; r = 0.42, 12 months; r = 0.39, 18 months; all p < 0.05). Bland–Altman plots demonstrated wide LVEF agreement limits (pooled agreement limits 3.0 ± 6.2). Both modalities demonstrated significant LVEF decline at 6 and 12 months from baseline, concomitant with increased LV volumes on CMR. Changes in NT-BNP correlated with changes in LV diastolic volume at 12 and 18 months (p < 0.05), and LV systolic volume at 18 months (p < 0.05). Changes in troponin-I did not correlate with changes in LV function or volume at any timepoint. In conclusion, CMR and MUGA LVEF are not interchangeable, warranting selection and utility of one modality for serial monitoring. CMR is useful due to less radiation exposure and accuracy of LV volume measurements. Changes in NT-BNP correlated with changes in LV volumes. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Breast cancer; Cardiotoxicity; Cardiovascular magnetic resonance; LVEF; MUGA; Trastuzumab","Adult; Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological; Biomarkers; Breast Neoplasms; Cardiac-Gated Imaging Techniques; Cardiotoxicity; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Middle Aged; Natriuretic Peptide, Brain; Peptide Fragments; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; Radiopharmaceuticals; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Factors; Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99m; Stroke Volume; Time Factors; Tomography, Emission-Computed; Trastuzumab; Treatment Outcome; Troponin I; Ventricular Dysfunction, Left; Ventricular Function, Left; amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; anthracycline; carboplatin; cyclophosphamide; docetaxel; doxorubicin; epirubicin; fluorouracil; methotrexate; paclitaxel; trastuzumab; troponin I; biological marker; brain natriuretic peptide; immunological antineoplastic agent; peptide fragment; pertechnetic acid tc 99m; pro-brain natriuretic peptide (1-76); radiopharmaceutical agent; trastuzumab; troponin I; adult; age distribution; Article; cancer patient; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; clinical article; cohort analysis; correlation coefficient; diagnostic test accuracy study; drug withdrawal; female; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle enddiastolic volume; heart left ventricle endsystolic volume; heart left ventricle function; heart left ventricle volume; human; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive breast cancer; infection; intermethod comparison; longitudinal study; middle aged; multicenter study; multiple cycle treatment; observational study; prospective study; radiation exposure; radionuclide ventriculography; blood; breast tumor; cardiac gated imaging; cardiotoxicity; comparative study; computer assisted emission tomography; diagnostic imaging; drug effect; heart left ventricle function; heart stroke volume; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; predictive value; reproducibility; risk factor; time factor; treatment outcome","C.

Additionally, to validate the motion-guided technique in comparison to chamber quantification with a vendor tool in post-chemotherapy breast cancer patients susceptible to cardiotoxicity. Approach: LV deformation data were acquired with the displacement encoding with stimulated echoes (DENSE) sequence on N = 21 post-chemotherapy female patients and N = 21 age-matched healthy females. The new chamber quantification algorithm consists of detecting LV boundary motion via a combination of image quantization and DENSE phase-encoded displacements. LV contractility was analyzed via chamber quantification and computations of 3D strains and torsion. For validation, estimates of chamber quantification with the motion-guided algorithm on DENSE and steady-state free precession (SSFP) acquisitions, and similar estimates with an existing vendor tool on DENSE acquisitions were compared via repeated measures analysis. Patient results were compared to healthy subjects for observing abnormalities. Results: Repeated measures analysis showed similar LV ejection fractions (LVEF), 59 % ± 6 %, 58 % ± 6 %, and 58 % ± 6 %, p = 0.2, by applying the motion-guided algorithm on DENSE and SSFP and vendor tool on DENSE acquisitions, respectively. Differences found between patients and healthy subjects included enlarged basal diameters (5.0 ± 0.5 cm versus 4.4 ± 0.5 cm, p < 0.01), torsions (p < 0.001), and longitudinal strains (p < 0.001), but not LVEF (p = 0.1). Conclusions: Measurement similarities between new and existing tools, and between DENSE and SSFP validated the motion-guided algorithm and differences found between subpopulations demonstrate the ability to detect contractile abnormalities.  © 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","cardiotoxicity; chamber quantification; displacement encoding with stimulated echoes; left-ventricular ejection fractions; radial basis function; radial point interpolation method; steady-state free precession","Automation; Chemotherapy; Torsional stress; carboplatin; cyclophosphamide; doxorubicin; paclitaxel; pertuzumab; trastuzumab; Automated approach; Displacement encoding with stimulated echoes; Ejection fraction; Image quantization; Left ventricular; Longitudinal strain; Repeated measures; Steady state free precessions; adult; algorithm; Article; breast cancer; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cardiotoxicity; clinical article; controlled study; curve fitting; data analysis software; displacement encoding with stimulated echo sequence; feature detection; female; heart left ventricle; heart left ventricle contractility; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle failure; heart ventricle remodeling; human; image analysis; image segmentation; interrater reliability; left ventricular chamber quantification; loading drug dose; middle aged; motion guided technique; multiple cycle treatment; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; radial basis function; radial point interpolation method; steady state free precession; validation study; Automatic guided vehicles","J.

Left ventricular ejection fraction, global and regional strain utilizing fast-strain-encoded, T1 and T2 mapping, and cardiac biomarkers (troponin and BNP [brain natriuretic peptide]) were analyzed. Methods: Sixty-one patients (47 with breast cancer, 11 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and 3 with Hodgkin lymphoma) underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance scans at baseline and at regular intervals during 2 years of follow-up. The percentage of all left ventricular myocardial segments with strain ≤-17% (normal myocardium [%]) was analyzed. Clinical cardiotoxicity (CTX) and sub-CTX were defined according to standard measures. Results: Nine (15%) patients developed CTX, 26 (43%) had sub-CTX. Of the 35 patients with CTX or sub-CTX, 24 (69%) were treated with cardioprotective medications and showed recovery of cardiac function. The amount of normal myocardium (%) exhibited markedly higher accuracy for the detection of CTX and sub-CTX compared with left ventricular ejection fraction, T1, and T2 mapping as well as troponin I (Δareas under the curve=0.20, 0.24, and 0.46 for normal myocardium (%) versus left ventricular ejection fraction, troponin I, and T1 mapping, P<0.001 for all). In addition, normal myocardium (%) at baseline accurately identified patients with subsequent CTX (P<0.001), which was not achieved by any other markers. Conclusions: Normal myocardium (%) derived by fast-strain-encoded cardiovascular magnetic resonance, is an accurate and sensitive tool that can establish cardiac safety in patients with cancer undergoing cardiotoxic chemotherapy not only for the early detection but also for the prediction of those at risk of developing CTX.

During the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we developed a Virtual-Hybrid Approach to build a de novo Cardio-Oncology Clinic. Methods: We conceptualized a Virtual-Hybrid Approach including three arms: information seeking in locations with existing Cardio-Oncology clinics, information gathering at the location for a new clinic, and information sharing to report clinic-building outcomes. A retrospective review of outcomes included collection and synthesis of data from our first 3 months (at pandemic peak) on types of appointments, cancers, drugs, and cardiotoxicities. Data were presented using descriptive statistics. Results: A de-novo Cardio-Oncology clinic was developed structured from the ground up to integrate virtual and in-person care in a hybrid and innovative model, using the three arms of the Virtual-Hybrid Approach. First, we garnered in-person and virtual preparation through hands-on experiences, training, and discussions in existing Cardio-Oncology Clinics and conferences. Next, we gleaned information through virtual inquiry and niche-building. With partners throughout the institution, a virtual referral process was established for outpatient referrals and inpatient e-consult referrals to actualize a hybrid care spectrum for our patients administered by a multidisciplinary hybrid care team of clinicians, ancillary support staff, and clinical pharmacists. Among the multi-subspecialty clinic sessions, approximately 50% were in Cardio-Oncology, 20% in Preventive Cardiology, and 30% in General Cardiology. In the hybrid model, the Heart & Vascular Center had started to re-open, allowing for 65% of our visits to be in person. In additional analyses, the most frequent cardiovascular diagnosis was cardiomyopathy (34%), the most common cancer drug leading to referral was trastuzumab (29%), and the most prevalent cancer type was breast cancer (42%). Conclusion: This Virtual-Hybrid Approach and retrospective review provides guidance and information regarding initiating a brand-new Cardio-Oncology Clinic during the pandemic for cancer patients/survivors. This report also furnishes virtual resources for patients, virtual tools for oncologists, cardiologists, and administrators tasked with starting new clinics during the pandemic, and innovative future directions for this digital pandemic to post-pandemic era. © 2021, The Author(s).","Cardio-oncology; Prevention; Telehealth; Telemedicine; Virtual care","anthracycline; protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor; trastuzumab; adult; advanced practice provider; algorithm; angiography; Article; breast cancer; cancer therapy; cardiomyopathy; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular system examination; clinical pharmacist; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; coronary angiography; coronavirus disease 2019; echocardiography; female; human; information seeking; longitudinal study; malignant neoplasm; mobile application; multidisciplinary team; myocardial perfusion imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nurse; observational study; outcome assessment; outpatient; outpatient care; pandemic; patient coding; personal experience; personalized medicine; physician; priority journal; retrospective study; risk assessment; teleconsultation; telemedicine; virtual hybrid approach; virtual reality","S.-A.

From November 7, 2013, to January 16, 2019, participants were recruited from 3 University of Toronto-affiliated hospitals. Data were analyzed from July 2021 to June 2022. Exposures: Sequential therapy with anthracyclines, trastuzumab, and radiation. Main Outcomes and Measures: CMR, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI), and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) measurements were performed before anthracycline treatment, after anthracycline and before trastuzumab treatment, and at 3-month intervals during trastuzumab therapy. CMR included left ventricular (LV) volumes, LV ejection fraction (EF), myocardial strain, early gadolinium enhancement imaging to assess hyperemia (inflammation marker), native/postcontrast T1 mapping (with extracellular volume fraction [ECV]) to assess edema and/or fibrosis, T2 mapping to assess edema, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) to assess replacement fibrosis. CTRCD was defined using the Cardiac Review and Evaluation Committee criteria. Fixed-effects models or generalized estimating equations were used in analyses. Results: Of 136 women (mean [SD] age, 51.1 [9.2] years) recruited from 2013 to 2019, 37 (27%) developed CTRCD. Compared with baseline, tissue biomarkers of myocardial hyperemia and edema peaked after anthracycline therapy or 3 months after trastuzumab initiation as demonstrated by an increase in mean (SD) relative myocardial enhancement (baseline, 46.3% [16.8%] to peak, 56.2% [18.6%]), native T1 (1012 [26] milliseconds to 1035 [28] milliseconds), T2 (51.4 [2.2] milliseconds to 52.6 [2.2] milliseconds), and ECV (25.2% [2.4%] to 26.8% [2.7%]), with P <.001 for the entire follow-up. The observed values were mostly within the normal range, and the changes were small and recovered during follow-up. No new replacement fibrosis developed. Increase in T1, T2, and/or ECV was associated with increased ventricular volumes and BNP but not hs-cTnI level. None of the CMR tissue biomarkers were associated with changes in LVEF or myocardial strain. Change in ECV was associated with concurrent and subsequent CTRCD, but there was significant overlap between patients with and without CTRCD. Conclusions and Relevance: In women with ERBB2-positive breast cancer receiving sequential anthracycline and trastuzumab therapy, CMR tissue biomarkers suggest inflammation and edema peaking early during therapy and were associated with ventricular remodeling and BNP elevation. However, the increases in CMR biomarkers were transient, were not associated with LVEF or myocardial strain, and were not useful in identifying traditional CTRCD risk.. © 2023 American Medical Association.

This study aimed to analyze myocardial injury using serial laboratory and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) parameters after epirubicin-based chemotherapy compared with left-sided radiotherapy and to study their value for early prediction of CTRCD. Methods: Sixty-six consecutive women (53 ± 13 years) including n = 39 with epirubicin-based chemotherapy and n = 27 with left-sided radiotherapy were prospectively studied by 3 T CMR including left ventricular (LV) mass and volumes for ejection fraction (LVEF), as well as feature-tracking with global longitudinal strain (GLS) and T1/T2 mapping. CMR was performed at baseline, at therapy completion (follow-up 1, FU1), and after 13 ± 2 months (FU2). CTRCD was defined as LVEF decline of at least 10% to < 55% or a > 15% GLS change at FU2. Results: T1 and T2 increased at FU1 after epirubicin-based chemotherapy, but not after left-sided radiotherapy. CTRCD occurred in 20% of patients after epirubicin-based chemotherapy and in 4% after left-sided radiotherapy. T1 at FU1 was the best single parameter to predict CTRCD with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.712 (CI 0.587–0.816, p = 0.005) with excellent sensitivity (100%, 66–100%), but low specificity (44%, 31–58%). Combined use of increased T1 and LVEF ≤ 60% at FU1 improved AUC to 0.810 (0.695–0.896) resulting in good sensitivity (78%, 44–95%) and specificity (84%, 72–92%). Conclusion: Only epirubicin-based chemotherapy, but not left-sided radiotherapy, resulted in increased T1/T2 myocardial relaxation times as a marker of myocardial injury. Combined use of CMR parameters may allow an early prediction of subsequent CTCRD. Key Points: • Myocardial T1 and T2 relaxation times increased at FU1 after epirubicin-based chemotherapy, but not after left-sided radiotherapy. • Cancer therapy–related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) occurred in 20% of patients after epirubicin-based chemotherapy and in 4% after left-sided radiotherapy. • Combined use of increased T1 and reduced LVEF had an AUC of 0.810 (0.695–0.896) to predict CTRCD with good sensitivity (78%, 44–95%) and specificity (84%, 72–92%). © 2021, The Author(s).","Breast cancer; Chemotherapy; Heart; Magnetic resonance; Radiation therapy","Breast Neoplasms; Cardiotoxicity; Epirubicin; Female; Heart Diseases; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Predictive Value of Tests; Stroke Volume; Ventricular Dysfunction, Left; Ventricular Function, Left; acetylsalicylic acid plus clopidogrel; angiotensin receptor antagonist; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; cyclophosphamide; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; epirubicin; gadoterate meglumine; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; paclitaxel; trastuzumab; troponin T; epirubicin; adult; area under the curve; Article; body mass; body surface; breast cancer; breast radiotherapy; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; contrast enhancement; controlled study; demography; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug tolerability; electron spin resonance; extracellular space; female; follow up; global longitudinal strain; heart cycle; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart muscle injury; human; image registration; longitudinal study; major clinical study; middle aged; practice guideline; prospective study; sensitivity and specificity; steady state; three-dimensional imaging; breast tumor; cardiotoxicity; cine magnetic resonance imaging; diagnostic imaging; heart disease; heart left ventricle function; heart stroke volume; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; predictive value","E.

Preclinical evidence demonstrates that exercise and caloric restriction can independently reduce anthracycline-related injury to the heart as well as cancer progression, and may be promising short-term strategies prior to treatment administration. For women with breast cancer, a short-term strategy may be more feasible and appealing, as maintaining regular exercise training or a diet throughout chemotherapy can be challenging due to treatment symptoms and psychosocial distress. Methods: The Caloric Restriction and Exercise protection from Anthracycline Toxic Effects (CREATE) study will determine whether acute application of these interventions shortly prior to receipt of each treatment can reduce anthracycline-related toxicity to the heart, aorta, and skeletal muscle. Fifty-six women with early stage breast cancer scheduled to receive anthracycline treatment will be randomly assigned to one of three groups who will: 1) perform a single, 30-min, vigorous-intensity, aerobic exercise session 24h prior to each anthracycline treatment; 2) consume a prepared diet reduced to 50% of caloric needs for 48h prior to each anthracycline treatment; or 3) receive usual cancer care. The primary outcome is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) derived left ventricular ejection fraction reserve (peak exercise LVEF - resting LVEF) at the end of anthracycline treatment. Secondary outcomes include MRI-derived measures of cardiac, aortic and skeletal muscle structure and function, circulating NT-proBNP, cardiorespiratory fitness and treatment symptoms. Exploratory outcomes include quality of life, fatigue, tumor size (only in neoadjuvant patients), oxidative stress and antioxidants, as well as clinical cardiac or cancer outcomes. MRI, exercise tests, and questionnaires will be administered before, 2-3weeks after the last anthracycline treatment, and one-year follow-up. Discussion: The proposed lifestyle interventions are accessible, low cost, drug-free potential methods for mitigating anthracycline-related toxicity. Reduced toxic effects on the heart, aorta and muscle are very likely to translate to short and long-term cardiovascular health benefits, including enhanced resilience to the effects of subsequent cancer treatment (e.g., radiation, trastuzumab) aging, and infection.

Methods: In this prospective 2-center longitudinal study, 41 women with HER2-positive breast cancer received adjuvant trastuzumab for 12 months, in addition to standard chemotherapy. Serial CMRs were performed at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months after initiation of trastuzumab. LA volumes were measured by a blinded reader. Linear mixed model was used to evaluate longitudinal changes. Results: Of 41 women (mean age 52 ± 11 [SD] years; 56% received anthracycline), one patient experienced trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity (TIC) for which trastuzumab was interrupted for one cycle. Mean baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 68.0 ± 5.9% and LA ejection fraction (LAEF) was 66.0 ± 6.6%. Compared to baseline, LAEF decreased significantly at 6 months (62.7 ± 5.7%, p = 0.027) and 12 months (62.2 ± 6.1%, p = 0.003), while indexed LA minimum volume (LAmin) significantly increased at 12 months (11.6 ± 4.9 ml/m2 vs 13.8 ± 4.5 ml/m2, p = 0.002). At 18 months, all changes from baseline were no longer significant. From baseline to 6 months, change in LAEF correlated with change in LVEF (Spearman’s r = 0.41, p = 0.014). No significant interactions (all p > 0.10) were detected between time and anthracycline use for LA parameters. Conclusions: Among trastuzumab-treated patients with low incidence of TIC, we observed a small but significant decline in LAEF and increase in LAmin that persisted for the duration of therapy and recovered 6 months after therapy cessation. These findings suggest that trastuzumab has concurrent detrimental effects on atrial and ventricular remodeling. Key Points: • In trastuzumab-treated breast cancer patients evaluated by cardiac MRI, left atrial ejection fraction declined and minimum volume increased during treatment and recovered to baseline after trastuzumab cessation. • Changes in left atrial ejection fraction correlated with changes in left ventricular ejection fraction in the first 6 months of trastuzumab treatment. • Trastuzumab therapy is associated with concurrent detrimental effects on left atrial and ventricular remodeling. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to European Society of Radiology.","Breast cancer; Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging; Left atrial remodeling; Trastuzumab","Adult; Anthracyclines; Atrial Remodeling; Breast Neoplasms; Cardiotoxicity; Female; Humans; Lamins; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Receptor, ErbB-2; Stroke Volume; Trastuzumab; Ventricular Dysfunction, Left; Ventricular Function, Left; Ventricular Remodeling; amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; anthracycline; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; trastuzumab; troponin I; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; lamin; trastuzumab; adjuvant therapy; adult; Article; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer chemotherapy; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; clinical article; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; controlled study; drug intermittent therapy; drug use; female; heart atrium remodeling; heart left atrium; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart volume; human; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive breast cancer; longitudinal study; middle aged; multiple cycle treatment; prospective study; treatment duration; adverse event; breast tumor; cardiotoxicity; complication; diagnostic imaging; heart left ventricle function; heart stroke volume; heart ventricle remodeling; metabolism; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging","A.T.

The main hypothesis based on the patients receiving antineoplastic chemotherapy treatment was CTRCD risk analysis with GLS that was independent of LV ejection fraction (LVEF). Methods: Displacement Encoding with Stimulated Echoes (DENSE) MRI was acquired on 32 breast cancer patients at baseline and 3- and 6-month follow-ups after chemotherapy. Two DeepLabV3+ Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) were deployed to automate image segmentation for LV chamber quantification and phase-unwrapping for 3D strains, computed with the Radial Point Interpolation Method. CTRCD risk (cardiotoxicity and adverse cardiac events) was analyzed with Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) models with clinical and contractile prognostic factors. Results: GLS worsened from baseline to the 3- and 6-month follow-ups (−19.1 ± 2.1%, −16.0 ± 3.1%, −16.1 ± 3.0%; P < 0.001). Univariable Cox regression showed the 3-month GLS significantly associated as an agonist (hazard ratio [HR]-per-SD: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.4–3.1; P < 0.001) and LVEF as a protector (HR-per-SD: 0.8; 95% CI: 0.7–0.9; P = 0.001) for CTRCD occurrence. Bivariable regression showed the 3-month GLS (HR-per-SD: 2.0; 95% CI: 1.2–3.4; P = 0.01) as a CTRCD prognostic factor independent of other covariates, including LVEF (HR-per-SD: 1.0; 95% CI: 0.9–1.2; P = 0.9). Conclusions: The end-point analyses proved the hypothesis that GLS is an early, independent prognosticator of incident CTRCD risk. This novel GLS-guided approach to CTRCD risk analysis could improve antineoplastic treatment with further validation in a larger clinical trial. © 2022","Artificial intelligence; Cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction; Cox proportional hazards; Fully convolutional network; Global longitudinal strain; Left ventricular ejection fraction","Antineoplastic Agents; Artificial Intelligence; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Global Longitudinal Strain; Heart Diseases; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Prospective Studies; Ventricular Dysfunction, Left; Ventricular Function, Left; antineoplastic agent; carboplatin; cyclophosphamide; doxorubicin; paclitaxel; pertuzumab; trastuzumab; antineoplastic agent; adult; area under the curve; Article; artificial intelligence; breast cancer; cancer survival; chemotherapy-related cardiac dysfunction; chemotherapy-related cardiac dysfunction; clinical article; convolutional neural network; diagnostic test accuracy study; drug induced disease; false positive result; female; follow up; global longitudinal strain; hazard ratio; heart disease; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle enddiastolic volume; heart left ventricle endsystolic volume; heart left ventricle mass; heart stroke volume; human; image segmentation; left ventricular end-diastolic diameter; left ventricular end-systolic diameter; loading drug dose; multiple cycle treatment; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; prognosis; proportional hazards model; prospective study; quantitative analysis; receiver operating characteristic; risk assessment; three-dimensional imaging; transesophageal echocardiography; breast tumor; diagnostic imaging; heart disease; heart left ventricle function; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy","J.

Methods and Results: In a prospective, continuously recruited cohort of 95 patients scheduled to receive potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy for breast cancer, lymphoma, or soft tissue sarcoma, measures of left ventricular end-diastolic volume, LVESV, global circumferential strain, and LVEF were acquired via cardiac magnetic resonance imaging before and then 3 and 24 months after initiating treatment by individuals blinded to all patient identifiers. Participants had an average age of 54±15 years; 68% were women, and 82% were of white race. LVEF declined from 62±7% to 58±9% over the 24 months (P<0.0001), with 42% of participants experiencing a >5% decline in LVEF at 24 months. Predictors of a 24-month >5% decline in LVEF included the following factors from baseline to 3 months into treatment: (1) >3-mL increases in LVESV (P=0.033), (2) >3-mL increases in LVESV or 10-mL declines in left ventricular end-diastolic volume with little change in LVESV (P=0.001), or (3) ≥10% deteriorations in global circumferential strain with little change in LVESV (P=0.036). Conclusion: During receipt of potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy, increases in LVESV, the absence of its deterioration during decreases of left ventricular end-diastolic volume, or the deterioration of global circumferential strain without a marked decrease in LVESV help identify those who will develop more permanent 2-year declines in LVEF. © 2020 The Authors.

Patients and methods: In this prospective longitudinal observational study, 41 women with HER2+ breast cancer treated with chemotherapy underwent serial CMR (baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months) after initiation of trastuzumab (treatment duration 12 months). LVEF and LV strain (global longitudinal[GLS] and circumferential[GCS]) measurements were independently measured by 2 blinded readers. Results: Of the 41 patients, 56% received anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Compared to baseline (60.4%, 95%CI 59.2–61.7%), there was a small but significant reduction in LVEF at 6 months (58.4%, 95%CI 56.7–60.0%, p = 0.034) and 12 months (57.9%, 95%CI 56.4–59.7%, p = 0.012), but not at 18 months (60.2%, 95%CI 58.2–62.2%, p = 0.93). Similarly, compared to baseline, GLS and GCS decreased significantly at 6 months (p = 0.024 and < 0.001, respectively) and 12 months (p = 0.002 and < 0.001, respectively) with an increase in LV end-diastolic volume, but not at 18 months. There were significant correlations between the temporal (6 month-baseline) changes in LVEF, and all global strain measurements (Pearson's r = −0.60 and r = −0.75 for GLS and GCS, respectively, all p < 0.001). Conclusion: There was a significant reduction in LV strain during trastuzumab treatment, which correlated with a concurrent subtle decline in LVEF and was associated with an increase in LV end-diastolic volume. LV strain assessment by CMR may be a promising method to monitor for subclinical myocardial dysfunction in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Future studies are needed to determine its prognostic and therapeutic implications. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging; Cardiotoxicity; Chemotherapy; Left ventricular ejection fraction; Left ventricular strain; Trastuzumab","Adult; Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological; Breast Neoplasms; Echocardiography; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Radionuclide Ventriculography; Receptor, ErbB-2; Trastuzumab; Ventricular Dysfunction, Left; anthracycline; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; trastuzumab; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; ERBB2 protein, human; immunological antineoplastic agent; trastuzumab; adult; Article; breast cancer; cancer chemotherapy; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; cardiovascular parameters; clinical article; female; global circumferential strain; global longitudinal strain; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle enddiastolic volume; human; longitudinal study; myocardial disease; myocardial strain imaging; observational study; priority journal; prospective study; breast tumor; chemically induced; cine magnetic resonance imaging; diagnostic imaging; echocardiography; heart left ventricle function; middle aged; procedures; radionuclide ventriculography","K.A.

Identifying factors that may be associated with fetal malformation and maternal and fetal prognosis has gained importance. We describe a 32-year-old woman with breast cancer who gave birth to a son with congenital bilateral cryptorchidism after treatment, with a literature review performed. CASE SUMMARY A 32-year-old woman with breast cancer who had been treated by surgery and radiotherapy experienced recurrence and underwent a second surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Her tumor cells were negative for estrogen receptor (ER) α, progesterone receptor (PR), and p53; positive for ERβ, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and Ki67. She had pathogenic BRCA gene mutations. She became pregnant within 2 years and delivered a boy with congenital bilateral cryptorchidism. The boy underwent bilateral orchidopexy. As of this writing, the woman and her son are both healthy. CONCLUSION HER2 overexpression, positivity for EGFR, Ki67, and ER, and PR negativity are associated with a poor prognosis in breast cancer. While no link has been established statistically between treatment for breast cancer and cryptorchidism in a subsequent pregnancy, this case suggests the possibility that ERβ and gene mutations may be contributing factors. © The Author(s) 2021.

Trastuzumab-based regimen has been the paradigm in guidelines as first-line therapy, whereas many patients got progressive disease after several cycles of treatment or rapidly progress because of primary resistance. Point mutations of ERBB2 gene occur in both HER2-amplication and non-amplification patients, with a 2% ratio in HER2 non-amplification cohort and 1.48% in HER2 amplication population. The acquired mutation ratio of ERBB2 substantially raised to 16.7%–17.7% in patients prior to trastuzumab treatment. ERBB2 mutation may be a critical reason of resistance and disease progression among the patients treated with anti-HER2 monoclonal trastuzumab or dual anti-HER2 antibodies with trastuzumab and pertuzumab, or tyrosine-kinase inhibitor. ERBB-2 mutation with L755S and V842I indicates resistance to trastuzumab, while that with L755S and K753I indicates resistance to lapatinib; these mutations maybe sensitive to pan-HER tyrosine-kinase inhibitors. A 48-year woman diagnosed with HER2-positive LABC developed trastuzumab resistance after three lines of trastuzumab cross-line treatment with partial response (PR) as the best response. The tissue was performed by next-generation sequencing (NGS), and the results discovered L755S in ERBB2 gene. Then, she received effective treatment with pyrotinib plus capecitabine and underwent mastectomy after six cycles of combined treatment with PR. Subsequently, breast mastectomy was performed, and she took pyrotinib plus capecitabine for 1 year and pyrotinib monotherapy for another 1 year as adjuvant therapy and achieved a long-term clinical benefit. In conclusion, pyrotinib is a potential neoadjuvant agent for patients who are heavily pretreated and harbor both ERBB2 amplification and ERBB2 mutant in locally advanced breast cancer. © Copyright © 2021 Gao, Xu, Wang, Wu and Sun.","breast cancer; ERBB2 mutant; HER2 positive; L775S; pyrotinib","anthracycline; antineoplastic agent; CA 15-3 antigen; capecitabine; carboplatin; carcinoembryonic antigen; cyclin dependent kinase; cyclin dependent kinase 12; cyclophosphamide; docetaxel; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; epirubicin; Ki 67 antigen; lapatinib; Myc protein; paclitaxel; pertuzumab; pyrotinib; taxane derivative; trastuzumab; trastuzumab emtansine; unclassified drug; adjuvant therapy; adult; Article; breast cancer; breast imaging reporting and data system; cardiotoxicity; case report; clinical article; erythema; female; gene; gene overexpression; HER2 gene; high throughput sequencing; human; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive breast cancer; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; mastectomy; middle aged; multiple cycle treatment; needle biopsy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; response evaluation criteria in solid tumors; skin flap; ulcer","","","Frontiers Media S.A.","2234943X","","","","English","Front.

However, cardiotoxicity, notably the decrease in left ventricular function under these regimens, can impair prognosis. Thus, prevention and treatment of cardiotoxicity are crucial. The present meta-analysis aims to assess the efficacy of beta-blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) for prevention of cardiotoxicity. Methods and results: We systematically searched Pubmed, Cochrane, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases for randomized controlled trials published until February 2019. The analysis included randomized studies that reported on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) after 6 months of chemotherapy in cancer patients who received beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors/ARBs for prevention of cardiotoxicity compared with controls. Studies on combination cardioprotective therapies were excluded from the analysis. The primary endpoint was prevention of a decrease in LVEF as defined by the individual study and as assessed by either transthoracic echocardiography or magnetic resonance imaging. We here show that patients under anthracycline-based chemotherapy have a moderate yet significant benefit in LVEF from beta-blockers or ACEs/ARBs. The beta-blocker analysis included 769 cancer patients, and the ACE inhibitors/ARBs analysis included a total of 581 cancer patients. The mean LVEF difference between the beta-blocker group and the control group was 2.57% (95% confidence interval 0.63–4.51, P = 0.009). The mean difference for ACE inhibitors/ARBs was 4.71% (95% confidence interval 0.38–9.03, P = 0.03). However, the beneficial effects throughout the studies were variable as documented by significant heterogeneity between the studies. Conclusions: Systematic evidence is needed to solidly found recommendations for cardioprotective prevention during chemotherapy. Likewise, trials on other neurohumoral drugs (spironolactone) and lipid-lowering approaches are required to improve protection for cardio-oncology patients. © 2019 The Authors.

Materials and methods: A total of 1151 patients with BC treated with anthracyclines, who underwent at least baseline, and first follow-up contrast-enhanced chest CT were evaluated. ECV and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were measured before (ECV0, LVEF0), during ((ECV1, LVEF1) and (ECV2, LVEF2)), and after (ECV3, LVEF3) AC treatment. ECV values were evaluated at the middle of left ventricular septum on venous phase images. Cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) was recorded. Results: Mean baseline LVEF values were 65.85% ± 2.72% and 102 patients developed CTRCD. The mean ECV0 was 26.76% ± 3.03% (N0 = 1151). ECV1, ECV2, and ECV3 (median interval: 61 (IQR, 46–75), 180 (IQR, 170–190), 350 (IQR, 341–360) days from baseline) were 31.32% ± 3.10%, 29.60% ± 3.24%, and 32.05% ± 3.58% (N1 = 1151, N2 = 841, N3 = 511). ECV1, ECV2, and ECV3 were significantly higher than ECV0 (p < 0.001). ECV0 and ECV1 showed no difference between CTRCD (+) and CTRCD (−) group (p1 = 0.150; p2 = 0.216). However, ECV2 and ECV3 showed significant differences between the two groups (p3 < 0.001; p4 < 0.001). Conclusion: CT-derived ECV is a potential biomarker for dynamic monitoring AC cardiotoxicity in patients with BC. © 2022, The Author(s).","Anthracyclines; Cardiotoxicity; Computed tomography; Extracellular volume; Myocardium","alanine aminotransferase; anthracycline; aspartate aminotransferase; cholesterol; high density lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein; triacylglycerol; adult; Article; breast cancer; cancer therapy; cardiac muscle; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular parameters; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; contrast enhancement; echocardiography; extracellular space; female; follow up; heart ejection fraction; heart function; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; hematocrit; hospital patient; human; image quality; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; retrospective study; risk factor","M.

We sought to determine (a) whether a structured exercise training program would attenuate reductions in VO                             2                              peak and (b) whether exercise cardiac imaging is a more sensitive marker of cardiac injury than the current standard of care resting left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Methods: Twenty-eight patients with early stage breast cancer undergoing anthracycline chemotherapy were able to choose between exercise training (mean ± SD age 47 ± 9 years, n = 14) or usual care (mean ± SD age 53 ± 9 years, n = 14). Measurements performed before and after anthracycline chemotherapy included cardiopulmonary exercise testing to determine VO                             2                              peak and functional disability (VO                             2                             peak < 18 ml/min/kg), resting echocardiography (LVEF and global longitudinal strain), cardiac biomarkers (troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide) and exercise cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to determine stroke volume and peak cardiac output. The exercise training group completed 2 × 60 minute supervised exercise sessions per week. Results: Decreases in VO                             2                              peak during chemotherapy were attenuated with exercise training (15 vs. 4% reduction, P = 0.010) and fewer participants in the exercise training group met the functional disability criteria after anthracycline chemotherapy compared with those in the usual care group (7 vs. 50%, P = 0.01). Compared with the baseline, the peak exercise heart rate was higher and the stroke volume was lower after chemotherapy (P = 0.003 and P = 0.06, respectively). There was a reduction in resting LVEF (from 63 ± 5 to 60 ± 5%, P = 0.002) and an increase in troponin (from 2.9 ± 1.3 to 28.5 ± 22.4 ng/mL, P < 0.0001), but no difference was observed between the usual care and exercise training group. The baseline peak cardiac output was the strongest predictor of functional capacity after anthracycline chemotherapy in a model containing age and resting cardiac function (LVEF and global longitudinal strain). Conclusions: The peak exercise cardiac output can identify patients at risk of chemotherapy-induced functional disability, whereas current clinical standards are unhelpful. Functional disability can be prevented with exercise training.                          © The European Society of Cardiology 2018.","cardiorespiratory fitness; cardiotoxicity; Exercise; heart failure; survivorship","Adult; Anthracyclines; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Breast Neoplasms; Cardiorespiratory Fitness; Echocardiography, Doppler, Pulsed; Exercise Test; Exercise Therapy; Exercise Tolerance; Female; Heart Diseases; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Middle Aged; Oxygen Consumption; Predictive Value of Tests; Primary Prevention; Prospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Stroke Volume; Treatment Outcome; Ventricular Function, Left; Victoria; anthracycline; brain natriuretic peptide; cyclophosphamide; docetaxel; doxorubicin; epirubicin; fluorouracil; hemoglobin; troponin; anthracycline; antineoplastic agent; adult; Article; body mass; breast cancer; breathing pattern; cardiopulmonary exercise test; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; cardiovascular risk; chemotherapy; clinical article; contraindication; diastolic blood pressure; echocardiography; electrocardiogram; exercise; female; heart arrhythmia; heart disease; heart function; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart papillary muscle; heart rate; heart stroke volume; hemodynamics; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; mitral valve; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physical activity; priority journal; systolic blood pressure; tissue Doppler imaging; weight; breast tumor; cardiorespiratory fitness; cine magnetic resonance imaging; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; diagnostic imaging; drug effect; exercise test; exercise tolerance; heart disease; heart left ventricle function; kinesiotherapy; middle aged; oxygen consumption; pathophysiology; predictive value; primary prevention; prospective study; pulsed Doppler echocardiography; risk assessment; risk factor; treatment outcome; Victoria","A.

We conducted a retrospective study to compare the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel with those of docetaxel as neoadjuvant regimens for HER2-negative breast cancer. Methods: In this retrospective analysis, a total of 159 HER2-negative breast cancer patients who had undergone operation after NAC were consecutively analyzed from May 2016 to April 2018. Patients were classified into the nab-paclitaxel group (n = 79, nab-paclitaxel 260 mg/m2, epirubicin 75 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2) and the docetaxel group (n = 80, docetaxel 75 mg/m2, epirubicin 75 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2) according to the drug they received for neoadjuvant treatment. The efficacy and adverse events were evaluated in the two groups. Results: The pathological complete response (pCR)(ypT0/isN0) rate was significantly higher in the nab-paclitaxel group than in the docetaxel group (36.71% vs 20.00%; P = 0.031). The multivariate analysis revealed that therapeutic drugs, lymph node status, and tumor subtype were the most significant factor influencing treatment outcome. At a median follow-up of 47 months, disease-free survival (DFS) was not significantly different in those assigned to nab-paclitaxel compared with docetaxel (82.28% vs 76.25%; P = 0.331). The incidence of peripheral sensory neuropathy in the nab-paclitaxel group was higher than that in the docetaxel group (60.76% vs 36.25%; P = 0.008), while the incidence of arthralgia was observed more frequently in the docetaxel group (57.50% vs 39.97%; P = 0.047). Conclusions: Compared with docetaxel, nab-paclitaxel achieved a higher pCR rate, especially those patients with triple-negative breast cancer or lymph node negative breast cancer. However, there was no significant difference in DFS between the two groups. This study provides a valuable reference for the management of patients with HER2-negative breast cancer.

Subclinical dysfunction otherwise undetected via LV ejection fraction (LVEF) was determined. Methods: Deformation data were acquired with the Displacement Encoding with Stimulated Echoes (DENSE) MRI sequence on 16 female patients who had CTA-based treatment. The contractility analysis tool consisting of image quantization-based boundary detection and the meshfree Radial Point Interpolation Method was used to compare chamber quantifications, 3D regional strains and torsion between patients and healthy subjects (N = 26 females with N = 14 age-matched). Quantifications of patient LVEFs from DENSE and Steady-State Free Precession (SSFP) acquisitions were compared, Bland-Altman interobserver agreements measured on their strain results and differences in contractile parameters with healthy subjects determined via Student's t-tests. Results: A significant difference was not found between DENSE and SSFP-based patient LVEFs at 58 ± 7% vs 57 ± 9%, p = 0.6. Bland-Altman agreements were − 0.01 ± 0.05 for longitudinal strain and 0.1 ± 1.3° for torsion. Differences in basal diameter indicating enlargement, 5.2 ± 0.5 cm vs 4.5 ± 0.5 cm, p < 0.01, and torsion, 4.7 ± 1.0° vs 8.1 ± 1.1°, p < 0.001 in the mid-ventricle and 5.9 ± 1.2° vs 10.2 ± 0.9°, p < 0.001 apically, were seen between patients and age-matched healthy subjects and similarly in longitudinal strain, but not in LVEF. Conclusions: Results from the statistical analysis reveal the likelihood of LV remodeling in this patient subpopulation otherwise not indicated by LVEF measurements. © 2019","3D strain; Breast Cancer; Cardiotoxicity; DENSE; Left-ventricular contractility; LVEF; RPIM","Adult; Aged; Antineoplastic Agents; Breast Neoplasms; Cardiotoxicity; Female; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Middle Aged; Muscle Contraction; Survivors; Ventricular Dysfunction, Left; Ventricular Function, Left; Ventricular Remodeling; doxorubicin; trastuzumab; antineoplastic agent; adult; Article; breast cancer; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer survivor; cardiotoxicity; clinical article; controlled study; female; heart left ventricle contractility; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart ventricle remodeling; human; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; steady state; three dimensional imaging; aged; breast tumor; cardiotoxicity; complication; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; etiology; heart left ventricle function; heart ventricle; heart ventricle remodeling; muscle contraction; pathophysiology; procedures; survivor; three dimensional imaging","J.

However, the literature is characterized by heterogeneous definitions and few reviews about the processes and outcomes of multidisciplinary care. The objective of this scoping review was to identify and classify the definitions and characteristics of multidisciplinary care, as well as outcomes and interventions for patients with breast cancer. Methods A systematic search for quantitative and qualitative studies about multidisciplinary care for patients with breast cancer was conducted for January 2001 to December 2017 in the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, and CINAHL. Two reviewers independently applied our eligibility criteria at level 1 (title/abstract) and level 2 (full-text) screening. Data were extracted and synthesized descriptively. Results The search yielded 9537 unique results, of which 191 were included in the final analysis. Two main types of multidisciplinary care were identified: conferences and clinics. Most studies focused on outcomes of multidisciplinary care that could be variously grouped at the patient, provider, and system levels. Research into processes tended to focus on processes that facilitate implementation: teamworking, meeting logistics, infrastructure, quality audit, and barriers and facilitators. Summary Approaches to multidisciplinary care using conferences and clinics are well described. However, studies vary by design, clinical context, patient population, and study outcome. The heterogeneity of the literature, including the patient populations studied, warrants further specification of multidisciplinary care practice and systematic reviews of the processes or contexts that make the implementation and operation of multidisciplinary care effective. © 2019 Multimed Inc.","Breast cancer; Breast neoplasms; Clinics; Conferencing; Interdisciplinary teams; Multidisciplinary management; Teamwork; Tumour boards","Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; Patient Care Team; Treatment Outcome; Article; bone metastasis; breast cancer; cancer grading; cardiotoxicity; clinical audit; clinical decision making; clinical decision support system; clinical outcome; data synthesis; descriptive research; health care personnel; health care quality; human; multidisciplinary team; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; outcome assessment; patient satisfaction; practice guideline; publication; qualitative research; randomized controlled trial (topic); resident; systematic review; teamwork; telemedicine; breast tumor; female; patient care; public relations; treatment outcome","N.N.

There is substantial variation in treatment outcomes, which is function of multiple variables, including access to treatment. Treatment standards can promote quality and improve survival; thus, their development should be a priority for the cancer-control planning. Methods: We extracted the guidelines for the treatment of BC from a systematic review of the literature. We evaluated the development process, the methodology, and the recommendations formulated and surveyed the country resource stratification. Metrics of health-system capacity were selected to study the guidelines context appropriateness. Results: We analyzed 49 distinct guidelines for BC, mostly in English language (n = 23), developed in upper-middle and high-income countries of the European and American regions (n = 39). A resource-stratified approach was identified in a quarter of the guidelines (n = 11), mostly from resource-constrained settings. Only one-half of the guidelines reached a gender balance of the authorship, and 10.2% were based on a multidisciplinary steering committee. A number of efforts and solutions of resource adaptations were recognized, mostly in low- and middle-income countries. Overall, the national guidelines appeared not sensitive enough of the local health-system capacity in formulating recommendations, with possible exception for the radiation therapy availability. Conclusion: This global landscape of treatment standards for BC demonstrates that the majority is not context appropriate. Research on the formulation of cancer treatment standards is highly warranted, along with novel platforms for developing and disseminating resource-appropriate guidance.  © 2021 The Author(s).

This study investigated an automated LV chamber quantification tool via segmentation with a supervised deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) before strain analysis with DENSE images. Segmentation for chamber quantification analysis was conducted with a custom DeepLabV3+ DCNN with ResNet-50 backbone on 42 female breast cancer datasets (22 training-sets, eight validation-sets and 12 independent test-sets). Parameters such as LV end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) and ejection fraction (LVEF) were quantified, and myocardial strains analyzed with the Radial Point Interpolation Method (RPIM). Myocardial classification was validated against ground-truth with sensitivity-specificity analysis, the metrics of Dice, average perpendicular distance (APD) and Hausdorff-distance. Following segmentation, validation was conducted with the Cronbach's Alpha (C-Alpha) intraclass correlation coefficient between LV chamber quantification results with DENSE and Steady State Free Precession (SSFP) acquisitions and a vendor tool-based method to segment the DENSE data, and similarly for myocardial strain analysis in the chambers. The results of myocardial classification from segmentation of the DENSE data were accuracy = 97%, Dice = 0.89 and APD = 2.4 mm in the test-set. The C-Alpha correlations from comparing chamber quantification results between the segmented DENSE and SSFP data and vendor tool-based method were 0.97 for LVEF (56 ± 7% vs 55 ± 7% vs 55 ± 6%, p = 0.6) and 0.77 for LVEDD (4.6 ± 0.4 cm vs 4.5 ± 0.3 cm vs 4.5 ± 0.3 cm, p = 0.8). The validation metrics against ground-truth and equivalent parameters obtained from the SSFP segmentation and vendor tool-based comparisons show that the DCNN approach is applicable for automated LV chamber quantification and subsequent strain analysis in cardiotoxicity. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","","Automation; Breast Neoplasms; Cardiotoxicity; Deep Learning; Female; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Semantics; Sensitivity and Specificity; adult; Article; automation; breast cancer; cancer patient; cardiac muscle; cardiotoxicity; classification; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; convolutional neural network; deep learning; female; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle enddiastolic diameter; heart left ventricle function; human; middle aged; multiclass classification; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; residual neural network; segmentation algorithm; sensitivity and specificity; validation process; automation; breast tumor; cardiotoxicity; diagnostic imaging; heart ventricle; image processing; pathology; procedures; semantics","B.J.

Methods: We prospectively recruited 60 participants (age: 49.8±11.6 years), 30 women with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer (15 with CTRCD and 15 without CTRCD) and 30 healthy volunteers. Patients were treated with anthracyclines and trastuzumab. Participants underwent three serial CMR (1.5T) and echocardiography studies at ∼3-month intervals. Cine-CMR for LV ejection fraction (LVEF), myocardial tagging for global longitudinal strain (GLS) and global circumferential strain (GCS), two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography for strain and LVEF and three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography for LVEF measurements were obtained. Temporal, interobserver and intraobserver variability were calculated as the coefficient of variation and as the SE of the measurement (SEM). Minimal detected difference (MDD) was defined as 2xSEM. Results: Patients with CTRCD demonstrated larger mean temporal changes in all parameters compared with those without: 2D-LVEF: 4.6% versus 2.8%; 3D-LVEF: 5.2% vs 2.3%; CMR-LVEF: 6.6% versus 2.7%; 2D-GLS: 1.9% versus 0.7%, 2D-GCS: 2.5% versus 2.2%; CMR-GCS: 2.7% versus 1.6%; and CMR-GLS: 2.1% versus 1.4%, with overlap in 95% CI for 2D-LVEF, 2D-GCS, CMR-GLS and CMR-GCS. The respective mean temporal variability/MDD in healthy volunteers were 3.3%/6.5%, 1.8%/3.7%, 2.2%/4.4%, 0.8%/1.5%, 1.9%/3.7%, 1.8%/3.6% and 1.4%/2.8%. Although the mean temporal variability in healthy volunteers was lower than the mean temporal changes in CTRCD, at the individual level, 2D-GLS, 3D-LVEF and CMR-LVEF had the least overlap. 2D-GLS and CMR-LVEF had the lowest interobserver/intraobserver variabilities. Conclusion: Temporal changes in 3D-LVEF, 2D-GLS and CMR LVEF in patients with CTRCD had the least overlap with the variability in healthy volunteers; however, 2D-GLS appears to be the most suitable for clinical application in individual patients. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Ongoing care after breast cancer treatment is often provided by primary care physicians. This care includes surveillance for cancer recurrence with a history and physical examination every three to six months for the first three years after treatment, every six to 12 months for two more years, and annually thereafter. Mammography is performed annually. Magnetic resonance imaging of the breast is not indicated unless patients are at high risk of recurrence, such as having a hereditary cancer syndrome. Many breast cancer survivors experience long-term sequelae from the disease or treatment. Premature menopause with hot flashes can occur and is managed with pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments. Vaginal dryness is treated with vaginal lubricants and gels. Because cardiotoxicity from chemotherapy is possible, clinicians should be alert for this complication and perform echocardiography if appropriate. Impaired cognition after chemotherapy is also common;treatment includes cognitive rehabilitation therapy. Patients with treatment-induced menopause develop decreased bone density and should receive dual energy x-ray absorptiometry and pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies. Others experience lymphedema, often best managed with weight loss and complex decongestive therapy. Some women develop chronic pain, which is treated by addressing psychological factors and with appropriate pharmacologic therapy. © 2019 American Academy of Family Physicians.","","Breast Neoplasms; Cancer Survivors; Chronic Pain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Female; Humans; Lymphedema; Mammography; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Primary Health Care; Risk Factors; amitriptyline; aromatase inhibitor; denosumab; doxorubicin; duloxetine; lubricating agent; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; paracetamol; tamoxifen; trastuzumab; vitamin D; zoledronic acid; alcohol consumption; anxiety; Article; body image; body weight loss; bone density; breast cancer; calcium intake; cancer epidemiology; cancer radiotherapy; cancer recurrence; cancer screening; cancer survivor; cardiotoxicity; chronic pain; cognitive behavioral therapy; cognitive defect; cognitive rehabilitation; depression; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; early menopause; echocardiography; emotionality; exercise; fatigue; fragility fracture; hereditary tumor syndrome; high risk patient; human; insomnia; lymph node dissection; lymphedema; mammography; manual lymphatic drainage; mastectomy; mindfulness; neuropathic pain; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; occupational therapy; ovary insufficiency; patient education; physical examination; postoperative pain; primary medical care; quality of life; recurrence risk; sentinel lymph node biopsy; smoking cessation; social interaction; vaginal dryness; verbal memory; visual memory; vitamin intake; weight bearing; breast tumor; chronic pain; cognitive defect; female; lymphedema; postmenopause osteoporosis; practice guideline; prevention and control; primary health care; procedures; psychology; risk factor; tumor recurrence","K.

Despite the large number of novel available therapies, radiotherapy (RT) remains as the most effective non-surgical method to cure cancer patients. In fact, approximately 50% of all cancer patients receive some type of RT and among these 60% receive RT-treatment with a curative intent. However, as occurs with any other oncological therapy, RT treated patients may experience toxicity side effects that range from moderate to severe. Among these, cardiotoxicity represents a significant threat for premature death. Current methods evaluate cardiotoxic damage based on volumetric changes in the Left Ventricle Ejected Fraction (LVEF). Indeed, a 10% drop in LVEF is commonly used as indicator of cardiotoxicity. More recently, a number of novel techniques have been developed that significantly improve specificity and sensitivity of heart’s volumetric changes and early detection of cardiotoxicity even in asymptomatic patients. Among these, the Strain by Speckle Tracking (SST) is a technique based on echocardiographic analysis that accurately evaluates myocardial deformation during the cardiac cycle (ventricular and atrial function). Studies also suggest that Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a high-resolution technique that enables a better visualization of acute cardiac damage. Methodology: This protocol will evaluate changes in SST and MRI in cancer patients that received thoracic RT. Concomitantly, we will assess changes in serum biomarkers of cardiac damage in these patients, including: high-sensitivity cardiac Troponin-T (hscTnT), N-Terminal pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NTproBNP) and Circulating Endothelial Cells (CECs), a marker of endothelial dysfunction and vascular damage. Discussion: The presented protocol is to our knowledge the first to prospectively and with a multimodal approach, study serological and image biomarkers off early cardiac damage due to radiotherapy. With a practical clinical approach we will seek early changes that could potentially be in the future be linked to clinical mayor events with consequences for cancer survivors. © 2021, The Author(s).","Cancer; Cardio-oncology; Cardiotoxicity; Circulating endothelial cells; Echocardiography; Magnetic cardiac resonance; Predictors; Radiotherapy","Breast Neoplasms; Cardiotoxicity; Clinical Protocols; Echocardiography; Endothelial Cells; Esophageal Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Myocardial Contraction; Natriuretic Peptide, Brain; Neoplasms; Peptide Fragments; Radiation Dosage; Radiation Injuries; Stroke Volume; Troponin T; Ventricular Dysfunction, Left; amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; troponin T; brain natriuretic peptide; peptide fragment; pro-brain natriuretic peptide (1-76); troponin T; acute cardiac toxicity; adult; Article; blood vessel injury; breast cancer; cancer radiotherapy; cancer survival; cancer survivor; cardiotoxicity; cause of death; circulating endothelial cell; clinical evaluation; clinical protocol; echocardiography; endothelial dysfunction; esophagus cancer; female; heart atrium function; heart left ventricle function; human; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; medical decision making; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; radiation injury; sensitivity and specificity; thoracic cancer; breast tumor; cardiotoxicity; clinical protocol; diagnostic imaging; endothelium cell; esophagus tumor; heart contraction; heart stroke volume; lung tumor; neoplasm; physiology; procedures; radiation dose; radiation injury","T.

Breast cancer treatment can negatively impact cardiac function in some breast cancer patients. Current methods (MUGA, echocardiography) used in clinical practice to detect abnormal cardiac changes as a result of treatment suffer from important limitations. Use of alternative techniques that would offer safe, inexpensive and non-invasive cardiac function assessment in this population would be highly advantageous. The aim of this study was to examine the agreement between impedance cardiography (ICG) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) in quantifying stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO) and end-diastolic volume (EDV) in this population. Approach. Sixteen breast cancer patients underwent ICG and CMR assessments at three time-points (before treatment, immediately after chemotherapy, and four months after chemotherapy). Bland–Altman analysis was used to quantify the accuracy and precision of ICG (relative to CMR) in estimating absolute values of SV, CO and EDV. Four methods (concordance rate, polar concordance rate, clinical concordance rate and trend interchangeability rate) were also used to assess ICG performance in tracking changes in these variables. Main results. Bland–Altman analysis showed that the accuracy of ICG relative to CMR was −3.1 ml (SV), 0.2 l·min−1 (CO) and −26.0 ml (EDV) and precision was 13.2 ml (SV), 1.1 l·min−1 (CO) and 20.1 ml (EDV), respectively. Trending ability assessment showed that (1) the concordance rate was 87% (SV), 73% (CO) and 73% (EDV), (2) the polar concordance rate was 67% (SV), 53% (CO) and 33% (EDV), (3) the clinical concordance rate was 33% (SV), 40% (CO) and 20% (EDV) and (4) the trend interchangeability rate was 29% (SV), 43% (CO) and 17% (EDV), respectively. Significance. Our findings show that, although ICG showed good accuracy for absolute SV and CO measurements and for CO and EDV changes, precision was poor for all variables in terms of both absolute measurements and trend tracking performance. This suggests that ICG cannot be used interchangeably with CMR in breast cancer patients. © 2021 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine","Bland–altman analysis; Breast cancer; Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging; Cardiotoxicity; Impedance cardiography; Method-comparison study; Trending ability","Breast Neoplasms; Cardiac Output; Cardiography, Impedance; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Stroke Volume; Diseases; Echocardiography; Electric impedance; Electric impedance measurement; Heart; Hemodynamics; Magnetic resonance imaging; Magnetism; Medical imaging; Resonance; Bland–altman analyse; Breast Cancer; Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging; Cardiotoxicity; Comparison study; Impedance cardiography; Method comparison; Method-comparison study; Stroke volumes; Trending ability; breast tumor; diagnostic imaging; female; heart output; heart stroke volume; human; impedance cardiography; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Electrocardiography","E.

Toxicities from this treatment approach are unpredictable, though usually reversible with management per established guidelines. Some patients suffer major morbidity and treatment-related mortality from these agents in an unpredictable manner. Cardiac and neurologic complications are rare, but can result in serious clinical consequences. Methods: We describe the presentation, management, and outcomes of eight sequential cases of combined cardiac and neurologic toxicities resulting in severe illness and demonstrating lack of rapid response to immunosuppression. Results: Our cohort consisted of six males and two females with an average age of 73.5 years (61-89 years). There were four patients with melanoma, and one patient each with urothelial carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, breast cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. Four patients received combination immunotherapy and four patients received monotherapy. The median time to presentation from treatment initiation was 27 days (11-132 days). All patients had a cardiovascular and neurologic toxicity, and most had hepatitis and myositis. The cardiac signs and symptoms were the prominent initial features of the clinical presentation. Each patient was managed by a multidisciplinary team and received a range of immunosuppressive agents. All patients died as a consequence of the immune related adverse events. Conclusions: The evaluation of patients with cardiac adverse events from immunotherapy, should include assessment of overlapping toxicities such as myasthenia gravis and myositis. Providers should be aware of the potential for an extended duration of disability and slow improvement for certain toxicities as these expectations may factor prominently in goals of care decisions.  © 2020 The Author(s).","Combination immunotherapy; Immune related adverse events; Myasthenia gravis; Myocarditis; Myositis","alanine aminotransferase; aminotransferase; antineoplastic monoclonal antibody; aspartate aminotransferase; biological marker; cholinergic receptor antibody; colchicine; creatine kinase; cyclophosphamide; durvalumab; gadolinium; immune checkpoint inhibitor; immunoglobulin; infliximab; ipilimumab; methylprednisolone; mycophenolate mofetil; naproxen; nivolumab; pembrolizumab; prednisone; pyridostigmine; sodium chloride; steroid; thymocyte antibody; ticilimumab; troponin; unclassified drug; add on therapy; adjuvant therapy; adult; aged; alanine aminotransferase blood level; aminotransferase blood level; areflexia; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; balance impairment; blurred vision; bradycardia; brain metastasis; breast cancer; breathing muscle; cancer immunotherapy; cardiac muscle; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; case report; cerebrovascular accident; chest tightness; cholesterol embolism; chronic kidney failure; clinical article; cohort analysis; combination drug therapy; complete heart block; contrast enhancement; creatine kinase blood level; diplopia; dizziness; drug dose increase; duodenum disease; dysphagia; dyspnea; electromyogram; erosion; fatigue; female; gastritis; globus hystericus; heart arrest; heart catheterization; heart edema; heart ejection fraction; heart left ventricle function; heart palpitation; heart right bundle branch block; heart right ventricle function; heart ventricle tachycardia; hemiparesis; hepatitis; hospice care; hospitalization; human; hypercapnia; immunosuppressive treatment; inappropriate vasopressin secretion; kidney cancer; limb weakness; liver function test; lung embolism; male; melanoma; meninx disorder; mental health; metastasis; metastatic breast cancer; metastatic melanoma; middle aged; monotherapy; multiple cycle treatment; muscle strength; muscle weakness; myalgia; myasthenia gravis; myocarditis; myositis; neuroimaging; neuromuscular disease; neurotoxicity; non small cell lung cancer; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; ophthalmoplegia; pain; patient comfort; pericarditis; plasmapheresis; presyncope; priority journal; protein blood level; ptosis (eyelid); QT prolongation; QTc interval; renal cell carcinoma; respiratory failure; respiratory tract intubation; resuscitation; second degree atrioventricular block; sinus tachycardia; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; supraventricular premature beat; telemetry; thorax pain; transitional cell carcinoma; transthoracic echocardiography; upper gastrointestinal bleeding; very elderly","E.M.

We studied eligible patients who were 18 years or older, who had breast cancer or lymphoma, and who were offered treatment with doxorubicin with curative intent dosing of 240 to 300 mg/m 2 body surface area between March 1, 2009 and October 31, 2013. Patients underwent baseline CMRI and ECHO. Both imaging studies were repeated after four cycles of treatment. Ejection fraction (EF) calculated by both methods was compared and analyzed with the inferential statistical Student's t test. Twenty-eight eligible patients were enrolled. Two patients stopped participating in the study before undergoing baseline CMRI; 26 patients underwent baseline ECHO and CMRI. Eight of those 26 patients declined posttreatment studies, so the final study population was 18 patients. There was a significant difference in EF pre- and posttreatment in the CMRI group (p = 0.009) versus the ECHO group that showed no significant differences in EF (p = NS). It appears that CMRI is superior to ECHO for detecting doxorubicin-induced reductions in cardiac systolic function. However, ECHO is less expensive and more convenient for patients because of its noninvasive character and bedside practicality. A larger study is needed to confirm these findings. © 2020 Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc..

The purpose of the present study was to noninvasively image the progression of radiation-induced cardiac inflammation in a large animal model using a hybrid PET and MRI system. Five canines were imaged using [                             18                             F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET to assess changes in myocardial inflammation. All animals were imaged at baseline, 1 wk, and 1, 3, 6, and 12 mo after focused cardiac external beam irradiation with image guidance. Radiation was delivered in a single fraction. The linear quadratic model was used to convert a typical multifractionated heart dose to a corrected single-fraction biologically equivalent dose. Immunohistochemistry was performed on excised left ventricular tissue samples from all five irradiated canines and one nonirradiated control canine to confirm the presence of inflammation. The mean doses delivered to the entire heart, left ventricle, left anterior descending artery, and left circumflex artery were 1.7 ± 0.2, 2.7 ± 0.2, 5.5 ± 0.9, and 1.1 ± 0.4 Gy, respectively. FDG standard uptake values remained persistently elevated compared with baseline (1.1 ± 0.03 vs. 2.6 ± 0.19, P < 0.05). The presence of myocardial inflammation was confirmed histologically and correlated with myocardial dose. This study suggests a global inflammatory response that is persistent up to 12 mo postirradiation. Inflammation PET imaging should be considered in future clinical studies to monitor the early changes in cardiac function that may play a role in the ultimate development of radiation-induced cardiac toxicity.                          © 2019 the American Physiological Society.","Canine model; Heart radiation effects; Inflammation; Positron emission tomography; Radiotherapy","Animals; Breast Neoplasms; Cardiovascular Diseases; Dogs; Female; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Multimodal Imaging; Positron-Emission Tomography; Radiation Dosage; Radiation Injuries; Radiopharmaceuticals; Radiotherapy; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; radiopharmaceutical agent; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; breast cancer; cancer radiotherapy; canine model; cardiac imaging; cardiotoxicity; clinical article; controlled study; coronary artery circumflex branch; disease association; drug uptake; external beam radiotherapy; female; heart function; heart left ventricle; heart tissue; human; immunohistochemistry; inflammatory cell; left anterior descending coronary artery; myocarditis; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; priority journal; quantitative analysis; radiation dose distribution; radiation dose fractionation; radiation injury; radiation response; adverse event; animal; breast tumor; cardiovascular disease; diagnostic imaging; dog; multimodal imaging; pathology; radiation dose; radiation injury","O.

Methods and Materials: We evaluated women who underwent primary breast surgery for breast cancer with (n = 520) or without (n = 774) adjuvant radiation therapy between January 2005 and May 2013. Patients who underwent breast surgery without radiation therapy were categorized as patients who received 0 Gy to the heart. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of a breast cancer treatment-related heart disease (BCT-HD), defined as a diagnosis of angina pectoris, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or atrial fibrillation. Results: In total, 1294 patients were included. The overall 5- and 10-year BCT-HD rates were 2.4% and 5.7%, respectively. The risk of an BCT-HD significantly increased per 1-Gy increase in the mean heart dose (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.23). Additionally, histories of hypertension (hazard ratio: 1.92), and diabetes (hazard ratio: 2.51) were found to be adverse risk factors, whereas regular physical exercise (hazard ratio: 0.17) was a protective factor. Subgroup analysis according to risk groups showed that the effect of increasing mean heart dose (per Gy) was similar between women without or with minimal risk factors (hazard ratio: 1.23) and women with multiple risk factors (hazard ratio: 1.27). Conclusions: The results indicate a radiation dose-effect relationship for cardiac disease in breast cancer patients, highlighting that there remains a considerable risk of cardiac toxicity even with 3-dimensional radiation therapy planning. Thus, measures to minimize the heart dose in breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant radiation therapy, even in those without any risk factor for cardiac disease, should be routinely implemented. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anthracyclines; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Breast Neoplasms; Cardiotoxicity; Diabetes Mellitus; Dose Fractionation, Radiation; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; Exercise; Female; Heart; Heart Diseases; Humans; Hypertension; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Mastectomy; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Radiation Dosage; Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted; Radiotherapy, Adjuvant; Retrospective Studies; Risk; Risk Factors; Young Adult; Cardiology; Diagnosis; Disease control; Hazards; Heart; Radiation; Radiotherapy; Risk assessment; Surgery; Toxicity; anthracycline; cyclophosphamide; doxorubicin; paclitaxel; trastuzumab; Adjuvant radiation therapies; Atrial fibrillation; Breast cancer treatment; Ischemic heart disease; Methods and materials; Myocardial Infarction; Radiation dose effects; Three dimensional radiation; adult; angina pectoris; Article; atrial fibrillation; axillary lymph node; breast cancer; breast surgery; cancer chemotherapy; cancer radiotherapy; cardiotoxicity; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; exercise; female; follow up; heart failure; heart infarction; high risk population; human; hypertension; intensity modulated radiation therapy; internal mammary lymph node; ischemic heart disease; major clinical study; modified radical mastectomy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; partial mastectomy; priority journal; retrospective study; risk factor; stable angina pectoris; supraclavicular lymph node; three-dimensional imaging; treatment duration; unstable angina pectoris; adjuvant radiotherapy; adverse event; aged; Asian continental ancestry group; breast tumor; cardiotoxicity; complication; heart; heart disease; Kaplan Meier method; mastectomy; middle aged; procedures; proportional hazards model; radiation dose; radiation response; radiotherapy planning system; risk; very elderly; young adult; Diseases","; ","","Elsevier Inc.","03603016","","IOBPD","33421556","English","Int.

Patients and methods: A total of 142 patients diagnosed from 2005 to 2016 were included in the study. The treatment consisted of a sequential regimen of taxanes and anthracyclines plus trastuzumab. The clinical and pathological responses were evaluated and correlated with clinical and biological factors. The cardiotoxicity profile and long-term benefits were analyzed. Results: The median age was 49 years, and 4%, 69% and 27% of patients had stage I, II and III breast cancer, respectively, while 10% had inflammatory breast cancer at diagnosis. Hormone receptor (HR) status was negative in 43%, and 62% had grade III breast cancer. The clinical complete response rate was 49% and 63% as assessed using ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, respectively, and this allowed a high rate of conservative surgery (66%). The pathological complete response (pCR) rate was 52%, and it was higher in HR-negative (64%) patients than in HR-positive (41%) patients and in grade III breast cancer (53%) patients than in grade I–II breast cancer (45%) patients. Patients who achieved pCR had longer disease-free survival and a trend toward improved overall survival. A total of 2% of patients showed a 10% decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction to <50% during treatment. All patients except one recovered after discontinuation of trastuzumab. Conclusion: A sequential regimen of taxanes and anthracyclines plus trastuzumab was effective, with high pCR rates and long-term benefit, and had a very good cardiotoxicity profile. © 2019 Antolín et al.","Cardiotoxicity; HER2-positive breast cancer; Neoadjuvant therapy; Pathological complete response; Survival","cyclophosphamide; doxorubicin; epirubicin; estrogen receptor; fluorouracil; Ki 67 antigen; paclitaxel; progesterone receptor; trastuzumab; adult; aged; Article; asthenia; body mass; cancer chemotherapy; cancer staging; cardiotoxicity; disease free interval; drug efficacy; dyslipidemia; echocardiography; echography; endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle biopsy; female; fluorescence in situ hybridization; follow up; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; human; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive breast cancer; hypertension; immunohistochemistry; liver toxicity; loading drug dose; lung embolism; major clinical study; mammography; mastectomy; middle aged; multiple cycle treatment; neoadjuvant therapy; neutropenia; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; observational study; overall survival; retrospective study; sentinel lymph node biopsy; treatment response; tumor volume","S.

With evidence showing that prevention of cardiotoxicity plays a significant role in increasing overall survival, there is an unmet need for accurate non-invasive methods to assess cardiac injury due to cancer therapies. Current clinical methods are too coarse and emerging research methods have not yet achieved clinical implementation. Approach: As a proof of concept, we examine myocardial elasticity imaging in the setting of premenopausal women diagnosed with hormone receptor positive (HR-positive) breast cancer undergoing severe estrogen depletion, as cardiovascular injury from early estrogen depletion is well-established. We evaluate the ability of our model-based cardiac elasticity imaging analysis method to indicate subclinical cancer therapy-related cardiac decline by examining differences in the change in cardiac elasticity over time in two cohorts of premenopausal women either undergoing severe estrogen depletion for HR-positive breast cancer or triple negative breast cancer patients as comparators. Results: Our method was capable of producing functional mechanical elasticity maps of the left ventricle (LV). Using these elasticity maps, we show significant differences in cardiac mechanical elasticity in the HR-positive breast cancer cohort compared to the comparator cohort. Conclusions: We present our methodology to assess the mechanical stiffness of the LV by interrogating cardiac magnetic resonance images within a computational biomechanical model. Our preliminary study suggests the potential of this method for examining cardiac tissue mechanical stiffness properties as an early indicator of cardiac decline.  © 2021 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","biomechanical modeling; breast cancer; cardiotoxicity; magnetic resonance imaging; mechanical stiffness","Biomechanics; Clinical research; Comparator circuits; Comparators (optical); Diagnosis; Diseases; Elasticity; Heart; Medical imaging; Noninvasive medical procedures; Oncology; Stiffness; estrogen receptor; hormone receptor; Biomechanical model; Breast Cancer; Cancer therapy; Cardiotoxicity; Elasticity imaging; Hormone receptors; Mechanical stiffness; Model-based OPC; Oestrogens; Overall survival; adult; Article; biomechanics; breast cancer; breast tissue; cancer therapy; cardiac imaging; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; clinical article; cohort analysis; diastole; elasticity; female; heart function; heart left ventricle wall; human; image registration; in vivo study; liver tissue; myocardial stiffness; non invasive procedure; premenopause; proof of concept; retrospective study; triple negative breast cancer; Magnetic resonance imaging","J.A.

Cardiovascular biomarkers may reflect myocardial injury, dysfunction, inflammation, and fibrosis and may precede and predict the development of left ventricular impairment. The aim of this study was to assess: (1) longitudinal change in circulating cardiovascular biomarkers, (2) the effect of metoprolol succinate and candesartan cilexetil on the biomarker response, and (3) the associations between on-treatment changes in biomarker concentrations and subsequent left ventricular dysfunction in patients with early breast cancer receiving anthracyclines. Methods and Results--This report encompasses 121 women included in the 2×2 factorial, placebo-controlled, double-blind PRADA (Prevention of Cardiac Dysfunction During Adjuvant Breast Cancer Therapy) trial with metoprolol and candesartan given concomitantly with anticancer therapy containing the anthracycline, epirubicin (total cumulative dose, 240-400 mg/m2). Cardiovascular magnetic resonance, echocardiography images, and circulating levels of biomarkers were obtained before and after anthracycline treatment. Cardiac troponins I and T, B-type natriuretic peptide, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, C-reactive protein, and galectin-3 increased during anthracycline therapy (all P < 0.05). The troponin response was attenuated by metoprolol (P < 0.05), but not candesartan. There was no association between change in biomarker concentrations and change in cardiac function during anthracycline therapy. Conclusions--Treatment with contemporary anthracycline doses for early breast cancer is associated with increase in circulating cardiovascular biomarkers. This increase is, however, not associated with early decline in ventricular function. Beta-blockade may attenuate early myocardial injury, but whether this attenuation translates into reduced risk of developing ventricular dysfunction in the long term remains unclear. © 2017 The Authors.","Beta-blocker; Brain natriuretic peptide; C-reactive protein; Cardio-oncology; Magnetic resonance imaging; Troponin","Adrenergic beta-1 Receptor Antagonists; Adult; Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; Benzimidazoles; Biomarkers; Biphenyl Compounds; Breast Neoplasms; Cardiotoxicity; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Double-Blind Method; Drug Therapy, Combination; Epirubicin; Female; Humans; Metoprolol; Middle Aged; Natriuretic Peptide, Brain; Peptide Fragments; Protein Precursors; Tetrazoles; Treatment Outcome; Troponin I; Troponin T; Ventricular Dysfunction, Left; amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; biological marker; brain natriuretic peptide; C reactive protein; candesartan hexetil; cyclophosphamide; epirubicin; fluorouracil; galectin 3; metoprolol; metoprolol succinate; neurohormone; troponin I; troponin T; angiotensin 1 receptor antagonist; antineoplastic antibiotic; benzimidazole derivative; beta 1 adrenergic receptor blocking agent; biological marker; biphenyl derivative; brain natriuretic peptide; candesartan hexetil; epirubicin; metoprolol; peptide fragment; pro-brain natriuretic peptide (1-76); protein precursor; tetrazole derivative; troponin I; troponin T; adult; Article; breast cancer; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; dose response; drug effect; early cancer; echocardiography; female; heart injury; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle failure; hormone inhibition; human; major clinical study; middle aged; pericardial effusion; priority journal; blood; breast tumor; cardiotoxicity; chemically induced; combination drug therapy; complication; controlled study; double blind procedure; heart left ventricle function; prevention and control; randomized controlled trial; treatment outcome","T.

We aim to investigate the use of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate early tissue changes and perform functional assessment of chemo- and radiation-induced cardiotoxicity and to identify MRI prognostic indicators of cardiotoxicity in breast cancer patients. Methods: A 3-min cardiac imaging protocol will be added to the breast MRI examination to diagnose cardiotoxicity in breast cancer patients. Standardized MRI-based evaluation of breast cancer and the left ventricular myocardium will be performed at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months and 2 years or more after cancer treatment. We will analyze both ventricular volume and ejection fraction (EF), strain of left ventricle (LV), native T1, extracellular volume fraction (ECV), and T2 values acquired in the mid LV. Discussion: The primary result of this study will be the comparison of the prognostic value of MRI parameters (native T1, ECV, both ventricular systolic function and LV strain) for cardiotoxicity. The endpoint is defined as the occurrence of a major adverse cardiac event (MACE). The secondary outcome will be an assessment of the temporal relationships between contractile dysfunction and microstructural injury over 4 years using MRI. This study will assess the usefulness of quantitative MRI to diagnose cardiotoxicity and will clarify the temporal relationships between contractile dysfunction and microstructural injury of the LV myocardium using MRI during breast cancer treatment.

Preclinical data suggest that dietary strategies of caloric restriction and low-carbohydrate intake can inhibit glycolysis, while acute exercise can transiently enhance blood flow to the tumor and reduce hypoxia. The Diet Restriction and Exercise-induced Adaptations in Metastatic Breast Cancer (DREAM) study will compare the effects of a short-term, 50% calorie-restricted and ketogenic diet combined with aerobic exercise performed during intravenous chemotherapy treatment to usual care on changes in tumor burden, treatment side effects, and quality of life. Methods: Fifty patients with measurable metastases and primary breast cancer starting a new line of intravenous chemotherapy will be randomly assigned to usual care or the combined diet and exercise intervention. Participants assigned to the intervention group will be provided with food consisting of 50% of measured calorie needs with 80% of calories from fat and ≤ 10% from carbohydrates for 48–72 h prior to each chemotherapy treatment and will perform 30–60 min of moderate-intensity cycle ergometer exercise during each chemotherapy infusion, for up to six treatment cycles. The diet and exercise durations will be adapted for each chemotherapy protocol. Tumor burden will be assessed by change in target lesion size using axial computed tomography (primary outcome) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived apparent diffusion coefficient (secondary outcome) after up to six treatments. Tertiary outcomes will include quantitative MRI markers of treatment toxicity to the heart, thigh skeletal muscle, and liver, and patient-reported symptoms and quality of life. Exploratory outcome measures include progression-free and overall survival. Discussion: The DREAM study will test a novel, short-term diet and exercise intervention that is targeted to mechanisms of tumor resistance to chemotherapy. A reduction in lesion size is likely to translate to improved cancer outcomes including disease progression and overall survival. Furthermore, a lifestyle intervention may empower patients with metastatic breast cancer by actively engaging them to play a key role in their treatment.

For this reason, a group of experts appointed by participating scientific societies, which includes the Spanish Society of Medical Oncology (Sociedad Española de Oncología Médica—SEOM), the Spanish Association of Surgeons (Asociación Española de Cirujanos—AEC), the Spanish Society of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (Sociedad Española de Ginecología y Obstetricia—SEGO), the Spanish Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (Sociedad Española de Medicina Nuclear e Imagen Molecular—SEMNIM), the Spanish Society of Oncological Radiotherapy (Sociedad Española de Oncología Radioterápica—SEOR) and the Spanish Society of Medical Radiology (Sociedad Española de Radiología Médica—SERAM), have worked together to establish consensus recommendations that allow the harmonization of management and ultimately the optimization of the healthcare of pregnant patients with cancer. When cancer is detected in a pregnant woman, the week of gestation in which the diagnosis is made must be considered, as well as the characteristics of the tumour. It is strongly recommended that a multidisciplinary team assesses the situation and guides the patient and her family during the informing, diagnosis and treatment process. Likewise, the foetus should be monitored and managed by specialized obstetricians who are part of a multidisciplinary cancer committee. © 2020, The Author(s).","Antineoplastic agents; Child development; Diagnosis; Follow-up; Prenatal care; Radiotherapy; Surgery; Systemic therapies","Female; Humans; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic; Article; bone scintiscanning; breast cancer; cancer chemotherapy; cancer mortality; cancer research; cancer staging; cardiotoxicity; cesarean section; colorectal cancer; computer assisted tomography; cone beam computed tomography; consensus; hypothyroidism; lumpectomy; lymph node biopsy; lymphoscintigraphy; malignant neoplasm; mammography; mastectomy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear medicine; ovary cancer; positron emission tomography; pregnancy; pregnant woman; premature labor; quality of life; radiation exposure; radiation protection; radical hysterectomy; rectum cancer; risk assessment; sentinel lymph node biopsy; uterine cervix cancer; uterine cervix conization; volumetric modulated arc therapy; consensus development; female; human; practice guideline; pregnancy; pregnancy complication","A.

However, substructures are not considered in radiation therapy planning (RTP) due to poor visualization on CT. Therefore, we developed a novel deep learning (DL) pipeline leveraging MRI’s soft tissue contrast coupled with CT for state-of-the-art cardiac substructure segmentation requiring a single, non-contrast CT input. Materials/methods: Thirty-two left-sided whole-breast cancer patients underwent cardiac T2 MRI and CT-simulation. A rigid cardiac-confined MR/CT registration enabled ground truth delineations of 12 substructures (chambers, great vessels (GVs), coronary arteries (CAs), etc.). Paired MRI/CT data (25 patients) were placed into separate image channels to train a three-dimensional (3D) neural network using the entire 3D image. Deep supervision and a Dice-weighted multi-class loss function were applied. Results were assessed pre/post augmentation and post-processing (3D conditional random field (CRF)). Results for 11 test CTs (seven unique patients) were compared to ground truth and a multi-atlas method (MA) via Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), mean distance to agreement (MDA), and Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests. Three physicians evaluated clinical acceptance via consensus scoring (5-point scale). Results: The model stabilized in ~19 h (200 epochs, training error <0.001). Augmentation and CRF increased DSC 5.0 ± 7.9% and 1.2 ± 2.5%, across substructures, respectively. DL provided accurate segmentations for chambers (DSC = 0.88 ± 0.03), GVs (DSC = 0.85 ± 0.03), and pulmonary veins (DSC = 0.77 ± 0.04). Combined DSC for CAs was 0.50 ± 0.14. MDA across substructures was <2.0 mm (GV MDA = 1.24 ± 0.31 mm). No substructures had statistical volume differences (P > 0.05) to ground truth. In four cases, DL yielded left main CA contours, whereas MA segmentation failed, and provided improved consensus scores in 44/60 comparisons to MA. DL provided clinically acceptable segmentations for all graded patients for 3/4 chambers. DL contour generation took ~14 s per patient. Conclusions: These promising results suggest DL poses major efficiency and accuracy gains for cardiac substructure segmentation offering high potential for rapid implementation into RTP for improved cardiac sparing. © 2019 American Association of Physicists in Medicine","cardiotoxicity; deep learning; magnetic resonance imaging; radiotherapy; segmentation","Deep Learning; Feasibility Studies; Heart; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Phantoms, Imaging; Radiation Dosage; Computerized tomography; Deep learning; Diseases; Heart; Image segmentation; Radiotherapy; Random processes; Cardiotoxicity; Coronary arteries; Deep learning; Ground truth; Mean distances; Radiation-induced; Random fields; Segmentation; Similarity coefficients; Therapy planning; Article; breast cancer; cancer patient; cardiac imaging; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; coronary artery; deep learning; four-dimensional imaging; great blood vessel; heart disease; human; image processing; image segmentation; radiation injury; diagnostic imaging; feasibility study; heart; imaging phantom; procedures; radiation dose; Magnetic resonance imaging","C.K.

We aimed to characterize the cardiac and cardiometabolic phenotype of trastuzumab-mediated toxicity and potential interactions with cardiac pharmacotherapy. Methods and results: This study was an analysis of serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and circulating biomarker data acquired from patients with HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer participating in a randomized-controlled clinical trial for the pharmaco-prevention of trastuzumab-associated cardiotoxicity. Circulating biomarkers (B-type natriuretic peptide, troponin I, MMP-2 and-9, GDF-15, neuregulin-1, and IGF-1) and MRI of cardiac structure and function and abdominal fat distribution were acquired prior to trastuzumab, post-cycle 4 and post-cycle 17. Ninety-four participants (51 ± 8 years) completed the study with 30 on placebo, 33 on perindopril, and 31 on bisoprolol. Post-cycle 4, global longitudinal strain deteriorated from baseline in both placebo (+2.0 ± 2.7%, P = 0.002) and perindopril (+0.9 ± 2.5%, P = 0.04), but not with bisoprolol (-0.2 ± 2.1%, P = 0.55). In all groups combined, extracellular volume fraction and GDF-15 increased post-cycle 4 (+1.3 ± 4.4%, P = 0.004; +130 ± 150%, P ≤ 0.001, respectively). However, no significant change in troponin I was detected throughout trastuzumab. In all groups combined, visceral and intermuscular fat volume increased post-cycle 4 (+7 ± 17%, P = 0.02, +8 ± 23%, P = 0.02, respectively), while muscle volume and IGF-1 decreased from post-cycle 4 to 17 (-2 ± 10%, P = 0.008,-18 ± 28%, P < 0.001, respectively). Conclusion: Trastuzumab results in impaired cardiac function and early myocardial inflammation. Trastuzumab is also associated with deleterious changes to the cardiometabolic phenotype which may contribute to the increased cardiovascular risk in this population.  © 2021 Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

The purpose was to longitudinally characterize myosteatosis (muscle fat), skeletal muscle metabolism, and oxygen (O2) consumption during cardiotoxic chemotherapy for breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients with stage I-III breast cancer were enrolled before trastuzumab-containing and/or anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. We used magnetic resonance imaging to non-invasively quantify thigh myosteatosis (fat-water imaging), and lower leg metabolism (31P spectroscopy), O2 consumption (custom techniques), and peak power output during single-leg plantarflexion exercise at pre-, mid-, end-chemotherapy, and 1-year. We also measured pulmonary VO2peak and maximal leg press strength. RESULTS: During chemotherapy, VO2peak and leg press strength decreased while peak plantarflexion power output was maintained. At mid-chemotherapy, hemoglobin decreased (16%) and lower leg blood flow increased (37%) to maintain lower leg O2 delivery; exercise Pi:PCr and myosteatosis increased. Between mid- and end-chemotherapy, lower leg O2 extraction (28%) and O2 consumption (21%) increased, while plantarflexion exercise efficiency (watts/O2 consumed) decreased. At one year, VO2peak and leg press strength returned to pre-chemotherapy levels, but lower leg exercise O2 extraction, consumption and Pi:PCr, and myosteatosis remained elevated. CONCLUSION: Lower leg skeletal muscle blood flow and O2 extraction adapt to compensate for chemotherapy-related hemoglobin reduction for small muscle mass exercise but are insufficient to maintain large muscle mass exercise (pulmonary VO2peak, leg press strength). The excess O2 required to perform work, increased Pi:PCr ratio and myosteatosis together suggest suppressed fat oxidation during chemotherapy. © The Author(s) 2022.

Observations suggest that regular exercise may be a useful therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular morbidity but it is yet to be interrogated in a large randomised trial. The primary aims of this study are to: 1) determine if 12-months of ET commenced at the onset of AC can reduce the proportion of BCa patients with functional disability (peak VO2, < 18 ml/kg/min), and 2) compare current standard-of-care for detecting cardiac dysfunction (resting left-ventricular ejection fraction assessed from 3-dimensional echocardiography) to measures of cardiac reserve (peak exercise cardiac output assessed from exercise cardiac magnetic resonance imaging) for predicting the development of functional disability 12-months following AC. Secondary aims are to assess the effects of ET on VO2peak, left ventricular morphology, vascular stiffness, cardiac biomarkers, body composition, bone mineral density, muscle strength, physical function, habitual physical activity, cognitive function, and multidimensional quality of life. Methods: One hundred women with early-stage BCa (40-75 years) scheduled for AC will be randomized to 12-months of structured exercise training (n = 50) or a usual care control group (n = 50). Participants will be assessed at baseline, 4-weeks following completion of AC (4-months) and at 12-months for all measures. Discussion: Women diagnosed with early-stage BCa have increased cardiac mortality. More sensitive strategies for diagnosing and preventing AC-induced cardiovascular impairment are critical for reducing cardiovascular morbidity and improving long-term health outcomes in BCa survivors.

We conducted a 12-month randomized controlled trial in 104 patients with early-stage breast cancer scheduled for AC to determine whether 12 months of exercise training (ExT) could attenuate functional disability (primary end point), improve cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2peak), and prevent cardiac dysfunction. Methods: Women 40 to 75 years of age with stage I to III breast cancer scheduled for AC were randomized to 3 to 4 days per week aerobic and resistance ExT for 12 months (n=52) or usual care (UC; n=52). Functional measures were performed at baseline, at 4 weeks after AC (4 months), and at 12 months, comprising: (1) cardiopulmonary exercise testing to quantify VO2peak and functional disability (VO2peak ≤18.0 mL·kg-1·min-1); (2) cardiac reserve (response from rest to peak exercise), quantified with exercise cardiac magnetic resonance measures to determine changes in left and right ventricular ejection fraction, cardiac output, and stroke volume; (3) standard-of-care echocardiography-derived resting left ventricular ejection fraction and global longitudinal strain; and (4) biochemistry (troponin and BNP [B-type natriuretic peptide]). Results: Among 104 participants randomized, greater study attrition was observed among UC participants (P=0.031), with 93 women assessed at 4 months (ExT, n=49; UC, n=44) and 87 women assessed at 12 months (ExT, n=49; UC, n=38). ExT attenuated functional disability at 4 months (odds ratio, 0.32 [95% CI, 0.11-0.94]; P=0.03) but not at 12 months (odds ratio, 0.27 [95% CI, 0.06-1.12]; P=0.07). In a per-protocol analysis, functional disability was prevented entirely at 12 months among participants adherent to ExT (ExT, 0% versus UC, 20%; P=0.005). Compared with UC at 12 months, ExT was associated with a net 3.5-mL·kg-1·min-1improvement in VO2peak that coincided with greater cardiac output, stroke volume, and left and right ventricular ejection fraction reserve (P<0.001 for all). There was no effect of ExT on resting measures of left ventricular function. Postchemotherapy troponin increased less in ExT than in UC (8-fold versus 16-fold increase; P=0.002). There were no changes in BNP in either group. Conclusions: In women with early-stage breast cancer undergoing AC, 12 months of ExT did not attenuate functional disability, but provided large, clinically meaningful benefits on VO2peak and cardiac reserve.

This study investigated an automated and supervised deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model for LV chamber quantification before strain analysis in DENSE images. Methods: The DeepLabV3 +DCNN with three versions of ResNet-50 backbone was designed to conduct chamber quantification on 42 female breast cancer data sets. The convolutional layers in the three ResNet-50 backbones were varied as non-atrous, atrous and modified, atrous with accuracy improvements like using Laplacian of Gaussian filters. Parameters such as LV end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) and ejection fraction (LVEF) were quantified, and myocardial strains analyzed with the Radial Point Interpolation Method (RPIM). Myocardial classification was validated with the performance metrics of accuracy, Dice, average perpendicular distance (APD) and others. Repeated measures ANOVA and intraclass correlation (ICC) with Cronbach’s α (C-Alpha) tests were conducted between the three DCNNs and a vendor tool on chamber quantification and myocardial strain analysis. Results: Validation results in the same test-set for myocardial classification were accuracy = 97%, Dice = 0.92, APD = 1.2 mm with the modified ResNet-50, and accuracy = 95%, Dice = 0.90, APD = 1.7 mm with the atrous ResNet-50. The ICC results between the modified ResNet-50, atrous ResNet-50 and vendor-tool were C-Alpha = 0.97 for LVEF (55±7%, 54±7%, 54±7%, p = 0.6), and C-Alpha = 0.87 for LVEDD (4.6 ± 0.3 cm, 4.6 ± 0.3 cm, 4.6 ± 0.4 cm, p = 0.7). Conclusion: Similar performance metrics and equivalent parameters obtained from comparisons between the atrous networks and vendor tool show that segmentation with the modified, atrous DCNN is applicable for automated LV chamber quantification and subsequent strain analysis in cardiotoxicity. Advances in knowledge: A novel deep-learning technique for segmenting DENSE images was developed and validated for LV chamber quantification and strain analysis in cardiotoxicity detection. © 2021 The Authors.

Anthracyclines are the cornerstone of chemotherapy in women with breast cancer. However, its clinical use is limited by their cardiotoxic effects that can trigger heart failure development. Vascular toxicity of chemotherapy may be linked with endothelial dysfunction because anthracycline damage of endothelial cells can lead to the development and progression of cardiomyopathy by decreasing the release and activity of endothelial factors and, ultimately, endothelial cell death. These processes suppress anti-inflammatory and vascular reparative functions and initiate the development of future cardiovascular events. Recent studies have shown that chemotherapy may induce toxicity in the vascular endothelium and is accompanied by systemic endothelial dysfunction in patients with diagnosed cardiovascular diseases. Because the initial endothelial cell insult is likely asymptomatic, there is often a long delay between the termination of doxorubicin therapy and the onset of vascular disorders. In this case, genetic susceptibility factor will help to identify susceptible patients in the future. The objectives of this study were to evaluate prognostic role of molecular (endothelin-1) and genetic factors (gene polymorphisms of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS3, rs1799983), endothelin-1 receptor type A (EDNRA, C+70G, rs5335) and NADPH oxidase (C242T, rs4673) in development of endothelial dysfunction and anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in women without cardiovascular diseases.  © 2021 S.

High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU or FUS) is a non-invasive approach for treating small tissue volumes and is particularly effective at inducing drug release from thermosensitive nanocarriers. Here, we present a novel MR-imageable thermosensitive liposome (iTSL) for drug delivery to triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). Methods: A macrocyclic gadolinium-based Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) contrast agent was covalently linked to a lipid. This was incorporated at 30 mol% into the lipid bilayer of a thermosensitive liposome that was also encapsulating doxorubicin. The resulting iTSL-DOX formulation was assessed for physical and chemical properties, storage stability, leakage of gadolinium or doxorubicin, and thermal-or FUS-induced drug release. Its effect on MRI relaxation time was tested in phantoms. Mice with tumours were used for studies to assess both tumour distribution and contrast enhancement over time. A lipid-conjugated near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) probe was also included in the liposome to facilitate the real time monitoring of iTSL distribution and drug release in tumours by NIRF bioimaging. TNBC (MDA-MB-231) tumour-bearing mice were then used to demonstrate the efficacy at retarding tumour growth and increasing survival. Results: iTSL-DOX provided rapid FUS-induced drug release that was dependent on the acoustic power applied. It was otherwise found to be stable, with minimum leakage of drug and gadolinium into buffers or under challenging conditions. In contrast to the usually suggested longer FUS treatment we identified that brief (~3 min) FUS significantly enhanced iTSL-DOX uptake to a targeted tumour and triggered near-total release of encapsulated doxorubicin, causing significant growth inhibition in the TNBC mouse model. A distinct reduction in the tumours’ average T1 relaxation times was attributed to the iTSL accumulation. Conclusions: We demonstrate that tracking iTSL in tumours using MRI assists the application of FUS for precise drug release and therapy. © The author(s).","Doxorubicin; Focused ultrasound; Liposome; MRI; Triple-negative breast cancer","Animals; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; Contrast Media; Disease Models, Animal; Doxorubicin; Drug Delivery Systems; Drug Liberation; Female; Gadolinium; Liposomes; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Mice; Mice, Nude; Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms; Ultrasonics; 1 stearoyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine; 1,2 distearoyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine; 4 (2 hydroxyethyl) 1 piperazineethanesulfonic acid; acetonitrile; alcohol; buffer; chloroform; contrast medium; dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine; doxorubicin; eosin; ester; ferric chloride; fluorescent dye; gadolinium(III)2 (4,7 bis carboxymethyl 10 [(N, N distearylamidomethyl N amidomethyl]1,4,7,10 tetraazacyclododec 1 yl)acetic acid; gadoteric acid; gallium; glucose; hematoxylin; lipid; liposome; liquid nitrogen; macrogol 2000; methanol; N carboxy 1,2 distearoyl sn glycero 3 phosphoethanolamine; N,N distearyl amidomethylamine; nanocarrier; nitric acid; polyacrylamide gel; polycarbonate; polyvinyl alcohol; sephadex; silicon dioxide; succinimidyl ester; traccert; trifluoroacetic acid; unclassified drug; antineoplastic antibiotic; doxorubicin; gadolinium; liposome; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer inhibition; cancer survival; cancer therapy; carcinogenesis; cardiotoxicity; contrast enhancement; controlled drug release; differential scanning calorimetry; dispersity; drug efficacy; drug half life; drug release; drug storage; encapsulation; fetal bovine serum; fluorescence imaging; focused ultrasound therapy; high intensity focused ultrasound; high performance liquid chromatography; hyperthermia; lipid bilayer; lipid conjugated near infrared fluorescence probe; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; magnetic field; molecular probe; mouse; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; photon correlation spectroscopy; relaxation time; shelf life; single photon emission computed tomography; size exclusion chromatography; staining; total reflection X ray fluorescence; triple negative breast cancer; X ray fluorescence; animal; disease model; drug delivery system; female; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nude mouse; procedures; triple negative breast cancer; ultrasound","M.

We measured leg blood flow, oxygenation, bioenergetics, and muscle composition in women with BC treated with anthracycline chemotherapy (n = 16, mean age: 56 years) and age- and body mass index–matched controls (n = 16). Materials and Methods: Whole-body peak VO2 was measured during cycle exercise. 31Phosphorus magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy was used to measure muscle bioenergetics during and after incremental to maximal plantar flexion exercise (PFE). MR imaging was used to measure lower leg blood flow, venous oxygen saturation (SvO2), and VO2 during submaximal PFE, and abdominal, thigh, and lower leg intermuscular fat (IMF) and skeletal muscle (SM). Results: Whole-body peak VO2 was significantly lower in BC survivors versus controls (23.1 ± 7.5 vs. 29.5 ± 7.7 mL/kg/minute). Muscle bioenergetics and mitochondrial oxidative capacity were not different between groups. No group differences were found during submaximal PFE for lower leg blood flow, SvO2, or VO2. The IMF-to-SM ratio was higher in the thigh and lower leg in BC survivors (0.36 ± 0.19 vs. 0.22 ± 0.07, p =.01; 0.10 ± 0.06 vs. 0.06 ± 0.02, p =.03, respectively) and were inversely related to whole-body peak VO2 (r = −0.71, p =.002; r = −0.68, p =.003, respectively). In the lower leg, IMF-to-SM ratio was inversely related to VO2 and O2 extraction during PFE. Conclusion: SM bioenergetics and oxidative capacity in response to PFE are not impaired following anthracycline treatment. Abnormal SM composition (increased thigh and lower leg IMF-to-SM ratio) may be an important contributor to reduced peak VO2 during whole-body exercise among anthracycline-treated BC survivors. Implications for Practice: Peak oxygen consumption (peak VO2) is reduced in breast cancer (BC) survivors and is prognostic of increased risk of cardiovascular disease-related and all-cause mortality. Results of this study demonstrated that in the presence of deficits in peak VO2 1 year after anthracycline therapy, skeletal muscle bioenergetics and oxygenation are not impaired. Rather, body composition deterioration (e.g., increased ratio of intermuscular fat to skeletal muscle) may contribute to reduced exercise tolerance in anthracycline BC survivors. This finding points to the importance of lifestyle interventions including caloric restriction and exercise training to restore body composition and cardiovascular health in the BC survivorship setting. © AlphaMed Press 2020","Anthracyclines; Breast cancer; Intermuscular fat; Magnetic resonance imaging; Muscle bioenergetics; Oxygen uptake; Skeletal muscle","Anthracyclines; Breast Neoplasms; Cancer Survivors; Energy Metabolism; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Muscle, Skeletal; Oxygen Consumption; anthracycline; creatine phosphate; anthracycline; adult; aerobic metabolism; aged; Article; bioenergy; body composition; breast cancer; cancer chemotherapy; cancer survivor; cancer therapy; cardiopulmonary exercise test; cardiorespiratory fitness; cardiotoxicity; clinical article; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; female; human; intra-abdominal fat; lipid composition; middle aged; muscle metabolism; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; oxygen consumption; oxygen extraction fraction; oxygen saturation; oxygenation; phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance; physical activity; priority journal; skeletal muscle; subcutaneous fat; breast tumor; energy metabolism; metabolism; oxygen consumption; skeletal muscle","M.J.

The primary objective was to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Secondary objectives included determining pharmacokinetics and clinical activity. Methods: This phase I trial was an open-label, single-center, dose-escalation study of single-agent AR-42 in primary central nervous system and advanced solid tumors. The study followed a 3 + 3 design with an expansion cohort at the MTD. Results: Seventeen patients were enrolled with NF2 (n = 5), urothelial carcinoma (n = 3), breast cancer (n = 2), non-NF2-related meningioma (n = 2), carcinoma of unknown primary (n = 2), small cell lung cancer (n = 1), Sertoli cell carcinoma (n = 1), and uveal melanoma (n = 1). The recommended phase II dose is 60 mg three times weekly, for 3 weeks of a 28-day cycle. DLTs included grade 3 thrombocytopenia and grade 4 psychosis. The most common treatment-related adverse events were cytopenias, fatigue, and nausea. The best response was stable disease in 53% of patients (95% CI 26.6–78.7). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.6 months (95% CI 1.2–9.1). Among evaluable patients with NF2 or meningioma (n = 5), median PFS was 9.1 months (95% CI 1.9–not reached). Conclusion: Single-agent AR-42 is safe and well tolerated. Further studies may consider AR-42 in a larger cohort of patients with NF2 or in combination with other agents in advanced solid tumors.

We tested the hypotheses that adjuvant treatment for early breast cancer with the anthracycline epirubicin is dose dependently associated with increased ECV fraction and total ECV, as well as reduced total myocardial cellular volume, and that these changes could be prevented by concomitant angiotensin or beta-adrenergic blockade. Methods and results PRevention of cArdiac Dysfunction during Adjuvant breast cancer therapy (PRADA) was a 2 × 2 factorial, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial of candesartan and metoprolol. Sixty-nine women had valid ECV measurements. ECV fraction, total ECV, and total cellular volume were measured by cardiovascular magnetic resonance before and at the completion of anthracycline therapy. ECV fraction increased from 27.5 ± 2.7% to 28.6 ± 2.9% (P = 0.002). A cumulative doxorubicin equivalent dose of 268 mg/m 2 was associated with greater increase in ECV fraction than doses <268 mg/m 2 (mean change 3.4% [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2, 5.5] vs. 0.7% [95% CI 0.0, 1.5], P = 0.006), as well as greater increase in total ECV (1.9 mL [95% CI 0.4, 3.5] vs. 0.1 mL [95% CI-0.6, 0.8], P = 0.04). In patients receiving candesartan, total cellular volume decreased (â 3.5 mL [95% CI â  4.7, â 2.2], P < 0.001) while in patients not receiving candesartan, it remained unchanged (P = 0.45; between group difference P = 0.003). Conclusions Anthracycline therapy is associated with dose-dependent increase in ECV fraction and total ECV. Concomitant treatment with candesartan reduces left ventricular total cellular volume. © 2017 The Author.","anthracyclines; breast cancer therapy; cardiac MR; cardiotoxicity; extracellular volume","Adult; Aged; Anthracyclines; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Benzimidazoles; Breast Neoplasms; Cardiotoxicity; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Cyclophosphamide; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Double-Blind Method; Epirubicin; Female; Fluorouracil; Hospitals, University; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Mastectomy; Middle Aged; Norway; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Statistics, Nonparametric; Stroke Volume; Survival Analysis; Tetrazoles; candesartan hexetil; cyclophosphamide; doxorubicin; epirubicin; fluorouracil; metoprolol succinate; anthracycline; antineoplastic agent; benzimidazole derivative; candesartan; cyclophosphamide; epirubicin; fluorouracil; tetrazole derivative; adult; Article; breast cancer; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer combination chemotherapy; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; controlled study; double blind procedure; drug effect; extracellular space; female; heart; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; human; intention to treat analysis; longitudinal study; major clinical study; medication compliance; middle aged; practice guideline; priority journal; prospective study; adjuvant chemotherapy; aged; breast tumor; cardiotoxicity; cine magnetic resonance imaging; diagnostic imaging; dose response; heart stroke volume; Kaplan Meier method; mastectomy; mortality; nonparametric test; Norway; pathology; pathophysiology; procedures; prognosis; randomized controlled trial; risk assessment; survival analysis; university hospital","T.

Fourty-one women with early stage HER2+ breast cancer underwent serial CMR (baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months) after initiation of trastuzumab therapy. A single, blinded observer measured LV parameters on de-identified CMRs in random order. Linear mixed models were used to investigate temporal changes. Compared to baseline, there were significant decreases in systolic function as measured by both left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (p <0.001 at 6 and 12 months) and peak ejection rate corrected for end-diastolic volume (PER/LVEDV) (p = 0.008 at 6 months, p = 0.01 at 12 months). However, these differences were no longer significant at 18 months. In contrast, significant reductions in diastolic function as measured by LV peak filling rate corrected for end-diastolic volume (PFR/LVEDV) were observed at 6 months (p = 0.012), 12 months (p = 0.031), and up to 18 months (p = 0.034). There were no significant temporal changes in the time to peak filling rate corrected for cardiac cycle (TPF/RR). The reduction in PFR/LVEDV at 18 months was no longer significant when corrected for heart rate. In conclusion, there were significant subclinical deleterious effects on both LV systolic and diastolic function among patients receiving trastuzumab. While there was recovery in LV systolic function after therapy cessation at 18 months, reduction in PFR/LVEDV appeared to persist. Thus, diastolic dysfunction may serve as a marker of trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity that needs to be confirmed in a larger study. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","","Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological; Breast Neoplasms; Diastole; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Stroke Volume; Systole; Trastuzumab; Ventricular Dysfunction, Left; Ventricular Function, Left; Ventricular Pressure; trastuzumab; immunological antineoplastic agent; trastuzumab; adult; Article; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer patient; cancer staging; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; cardiovascular parameters; clinical article; controlled study; female; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle function; heart rate; human; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive breast cancer; left ventricular diastolic function; left ventricular end diastolic volume index; left ventricular end systolic volume index; left ventricular systolic function; longitudinal study; multiple cycle treatment; observational study; peak ejection rate left ventricular end diastolic volume; peak filling rate left ventricular end diastolic volume; priority journal; prospective study; single blind procedure; time to peak filling rate corrected for cardiac cycle; breast tumor; cancer staging; cine magnetic resonance imaging; clinical trial; diagnostic imaging; diastole; drug effect; follow up; heart left ventricle function; heart stroke volume; heart ventricle; heart ventricle pressure; middle aged; multicenter study; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; prognosis; systole","A.T.

When a patient has both heart disease and cancer, the treatment can be complicated because treatment for one condition can have an adverse effect on the outcome of the other. A cardiovascular disease that involves heart failures, coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, pericardial diseases, arrhythmias, and valve and vascular dysfunction is a serious worry for long-term cancer patients. Because preclinical research is limited, it is critical to comprehend the pathophysiology of CVD as a consequence of anticancerous therapies while taking into account the developing and expanding heart. As a result, in this research, we look at the epidemiological characteristics of cancer patients who also have cardiovascular illness. Low-dose chest computed tomography, cardiac CT, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used to acquire the data and perform the screening. Chemotherapeutic drugs such as anthracyclines and trastuzumab are used to treat the condition. Univariate analysis is used to examine risk factors and predict cardiovascular damage. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, life expectancy, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and longitudinal strain are among the metrics examined. © 2022 Guangchong Zhang et al.","","anthracycline; arsenic trioxide; bevacizumab; cisplatin; cyclophosphamide; epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor; protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor; pyrimidine derivative; sorafenib; trastuzumab; troponin I; vasculotropin inhibitor; acute toxicity; adult; artery thrombosis; Article; breast cancer; breast tumor; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer registry; cardiac imaging; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; cardiovascular mortality; chronic toxicity; colorectal cancer; colorectal tumor; computer assisted tomography; congestive cardiomyopathy; congestive heart failure; controlled study; coronary artery spasm; coronary artery thrombosis; diagnostic test accuracy study; endothelium lesion; female; follow up; heart arrhythmia; heart disease; heart infarction; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle failure; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; heart muscle injury; heart muscle ischemia; human; hypertension; iron overload; left ventricular systolic dysfunction; life expectancy; lung tumor; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; myocarditis; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; peripheral occlusive artery disease; pleura effusion; prediction; predictive value; primary tumor; prostate cancer; pulmonary hypertension; radiation dose; rectum cancer; rectum tumor; screening test; sensitivity and specificity; side effect; small cell lung cancer; thorax radiography; thromboembolism; univariate analysis","G.

Methods: HER2-positive breast cancer patients receiving trastuzumab, with or without anthracycline, underwent 2DE-ST at baseline and after 3 and 6 months (m) trastuzumab. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging (with ST) was performed at baseline and 6 m. We studied the correlation between 2DE-ST- and CMR-derived global longitudinal strain (GLS) and global radial strain (GRS) measured at the same time. Additionally, we associated baseline and 3 m 2DE-ST measurements with later CMR-LVEF, and with cardiotoxicity, defined as CMR-LVEF < 45% and/or absolute decline > 10% during trastuzumab. Results: Forty-seven patients were included. Median baseline LVEF was 60.4%. GLS measurements based on 2DE-ST and CMR showed weak correlation (Pearson’s r = 0.33; p = 0.041); GRS measurements were uncorrelated (r = 0.09; p = 0.979). 2DE-LVEF at baseline and 3 m, and 2DE-ST-GLS at 3 m were predictive of CMR-LVEF at 6 m. In contrast, the change in 2DE-ST-GLS at 3 m was predictive of the change in CMR-LVEF at 6 m, whereas the change in 2DE-LVEF was not. Importantly, the 11 patients who developed cardiotoxicity (28%) had larger 2DE-ST-GLS change at 3 m than those who did not (median 5.2%-points versus 1.7%-points; odds ratio for 1% difference change 1.81, 95% confidence interval 1.11–2.93; p = 0.016; explained variance 0.34). Conclusions: Correlations between 2DE-ST and CMR-derived measurements are weak. Nevertheless, ST-measurements appeared useful to improve the performance of 2DE in predicting LVEF changes after 6 m of trastuzumab treatment. © 2021, The Author(s).","Cardiac MRI; HER2-positive breast cancer; Speckle tracking echocardiography; Strain imaging; Trastuzumab","Breast Neoplasms; Echocardiography; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Prospective Studies; Stroke Volume; Trastuzumab; Ventricular Dysfunction, Left; Ventricular Function, Left; trastuzumab; trastuzumab; adult; Article; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; cardiovascular parameters; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; correlational study; female; global longitudinal strain; global radial strain; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; human; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive breast cancer; intermethod comparison; middle aged; Netherlands; observational study; predictive value; prospective study; two dimensional echocardiography; two dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography; breast tumor; diagnostic imaging; echocardiography; heart left ventricle function; heart stroke volume; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging","N.I.

Displacement Encoding with Stimulated Echoes cardiac image phases acquired from 30 breast cancer patients and 30 healthy females were unwrapped via a DeepLabV3 + fully convolutional network (FCN). Myocardial strains were directly computed from the unwrapped phases with the Radial Point Interpolation Method. FCN-unwrapped phases of a phantom's rotating gel were validated against quality-guided phase-unwrapping (QGPU) and robust transport of intensity equation (RTIE) phase-unwrapping. FCN performance on unwrapping human LV data was measured with F1 and Dice scores versus QGPU ground-truth. The reliability of FCN-based strains was assessed against RTIE-based strains with Cronbach's alpha (C-α) intraclass correlation coefficient. Mean squared error (MSE) of unwrapping the phantom experiment data at 0 dB signal-to-noise ratio were 1.6, 2.7 and 6.1 with FCN, QGPU and RTIE techniques. Human data classification accuracies were F1 = 0.95 (Dice = 0.96) with FCN and F1 = 0.94 (Dice = 0.95) with RTIE. GLS results from FCN and RTIE were −16 ± 3% vs. −16 ± 3% (C-α = 0.9) for patients and −20 ± 3% vs. −20 ± 3% (C-α = 0.9) for healthy subjects. The low MSE from the phantom validation demonstrates accuracy of phase-unwrapping with the FCN and comparable human subject results versus RTIE demonstrate GLS analysis accuracy. A deep-learning methodology for phase-unwrapping in medical images and GLS computation was developed and validated in a heterogeneous cohort. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cardiotoxicity; Deep-learning; DENSE; Fully convolutional network; Phase-unwrapping","Breast Neoplasms; Deep Learning; Female; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Reproducibility of Results; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Diseases; Mean square error; Medical imaging; Phantoms; Semantic Segmentation; Semantics; Signal to noise ratio; Strain; Cardiotoxicity; Convolutional networks; Deep-learning; DENSE; Fully convolutional network; Intensity equation; Left ventricular; Longitudinal strain; Phase-unwrapping; Transport of intensity; adult; Article; breast cancer; cardiac imaging; cardiotoxicity; clinical article; computer model; controlled study; convolutional neural network; Cronbach alpha coefficient; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; female; global longitudinal strain; human; image quality; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; breast tumor; diagnostic imaging; heart ventricle; reproducibility; Deep learning","J.

Methods: A validated and automated MRI-based LV contractility analysis tool consisting of quantization-based boundary detection, unwrapping of image phases and the meshfree Radial Point Interpolation Method was used toward measuring LV chamber quantifications (LVCQ), three-dimensional strains and torsions in patients and healthy subjects. Data were acquired with the Displacement Encoding with Stimulated Echoes (DENSE) sequence on 21 female patients and 21 age-matched healthy females. Estimates of patient LVCQs from DENSE acquisitions were validated in comparison to similar steady-state free precession measurements and their strain results validated via Bland–Altman interobserver agreements. The occurrence of LV abnormalities was investigated via significant differences in contractility measurements (LVCQs, strains and torsions) between patients and healthy subjects.; Results: Repeated measures analysis showed similarities between LVCQ measurements from DENSE and steady-state free precession, including cardiac output (4.7 ± 0.4 L, 4.6 ± 0.4 L, p = 0.8), and LV ejection fractions (59±6%, 58±5%, p = 0.2). Differences found between patients and healthy subjects included enlarged basal diameter (5.0 ± 0.5 cm vs 4.4 ± 0.5 cm, p < 0.01), apical torsion (6.0 ± 1.1° vs 9.7 ± 1.4°, p < 0.001) and global longitudinal strain (−0.15 ± 0.02 vs. -0.21 ± 0.04, p < 0.001), but not LV ejection fraction (59±6% vs. 63±6%, p = 0.1). Conclusion: The results from the statistical analysis reveal the possibility of LV abnormalities in the post-chemotherapy patients via enlarged basal diameter and reduced longitudinal strain and torsion, in comparison to healthy subjects. Advances in knowledge: This study shows that subclinical LV abnormalities in post-chemotherapy breast cancer patients can be detected with an automated technique for the comprehensive analysis of contractile parameters. © 2020 The Authors.

In this cross-sectional pilot study, radiation dose distributions were correlated with areas of localized and diffuse myocardial fibrosis as measured by novel cardiac MRI (CMR) sequences including late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and T1 mapping with the goal to identify early markers of myocardial damage. Materials and methods: Twenty-eight patients with chest tumors including lung, breast, esophagus, and lymphoma underwent CMR per study protocol on average 46.4 months (range 1.7-344.5) after radiotherapy. Patients without pretreatment cardiac history were included if the volume of heart receiving 5 Gy or more was at least 10% (V5Gy ≥ 10%). The association of LGE with cardiac dosimetric factors, clinical factors (e.g., tumor type, smoking history, BMI), and T1 values was analyzed. Results: Cardiac maximum (Dmax) and mean dose (Dmean) equivalent to doses delivered in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2) were on average 50.9 Gy (range 6.2-108.0) and 8.2 Gy (range 1.0-35.7), respectively, compared to 60.8 Gy (40.8-108.0) and 6.8 Gy (1.8-21.8) among the 9 patients with LGE. Doses were not different between patients with and without LGE (p = 0.16 and 0.56, respectively). The average T1 value of the left ventricle myocardium was 1009 ms (range 933-1117). No significant correlation was seen for heart Dmax and Dmean and T1 values (p = 0.14 and 0.58, respectively). In addition, no significant association between clinical factors and the development of LGE was identified. Conclusions: No relation between cardiac doses, the presence of LGE or T1 values was observed. Further study is needed to determine the benefit of CMR for detecting radiotherapy-related myocardial fibrosis.  © 2020 The Author(s).","Cardiac MRI; Cardiotoxicity from radiotherapy; Late gadolinium enhancement; Radiation induced heart disease; T1 mapping","carboplatin; doxorubicin; gadolinium; gadoteridol; paclitaxel; trastuzumab; adult; aged; Article; body mass; breast cancer; breast tumor; cancer radiotherapy; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; chemotherapy; clinical article; cohort analysis; contrast enhancement; cross-sectional study; esophagus tumor; female; heart disease; heart left ventricle; heart muscle fibrosis; heart muscle injury; human; lung cancer; lung tumor; lymphoma; male; middle aged; pilot study; priority journal; radiation dose; radiation dose distribution; radiation injury; smoking; very elderly","A.

Several trials investigated the neoadjuvant efficacy of dual HER2 blockade with anthracycline-free chemotherapy, whereas few data are available on single-agent trastuzumab and anthracycline-based regimens, which represent the standard of care in the adjuvant setting. This phase II, single-arm trial assessed anthracycline-based chemotherapy and trastuzumab as neoadjuvant treatment for high-risk HER2-positive breast cancer. Methods: Forty-three patients with stage II–III HER2-positive breast cancer were treated with 4 courses of neoadjuvant 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m2, epirubicin 90 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 (FEC ×4) every 21 days, followed by 12 courses of weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 and trastuzumab 2 mg/Kg IV (loading dose 4 mg/kg). Results: Pathologic complete response (pCR) was observed in 22 (51%) of 43 patients. After a median follow-up of 6 years, the 5-year disease-free survival and overall survival were 85.8% (95% confidence interval 75.9%–97%) and 89.6% (80.4%–99.8%), respectively. A temporary decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction was observed in two patients. No cardiac death or congestive heart failure occurred. One patient died due to febrile neutropenia. Conclusions: FEC ×4 followed by paclitaxel and trastuzumab was associated with high pCR rates and favorable long-term outcomes. However, this regimen was associated with relevant hematologic toxicity. © Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori 2022.","anthracycline-based chemotherapy; Breast cancer; early breast cancer; HER2-positive breast cancer; neoadjuvant chemotherapy; trastuzumab","Anthracyclines; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Breast Neoplasms; Cyclophosphamide; Epirubicin; Female; Humans; Neoadjuvant Therapy; Paclitaxel; Receptor, ErbB-2; Stroke Volume; Taxoids; Trastuzumab; Ventricular Function, Left; cyclophosphamide; epirubicin; fluorouracil; paclitaxel; trastuzumab; anthracycline; antineoplastic agent; cyclophosphamide; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; epirubicin; monoclonal antibody; paclitaxel; taxane; taxoid; trastuzumab; adjuvant therapy; adult; adverse drug reaction; aged; anemia; Article; bone scintiscanning; breast radiotherapy; breast surgery; breast-conserving surgery; cancer staging; cardiotoxicity; clinical article; Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events; constipation; diarrhea; distant metastasis; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug withdrawal; dyspnea; echocardiography; echography; ECOG Performance Status; estrogen receptor positive breast cancer; fatigue; febrile neutropenia; female; fever; fluorescence in situ hybridization; follow up; gene amplification; heart arrhythmia; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; high risk patient; human; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive breast cancer; Italy; liver disease; loading drug dose; long term care; mammography; mucosa inflammation; multicenter study; multiple cycle treatment; nausea and vomiting; neoadjuvant chemotherapy; neurotoxicity; neutropenia; New York Heart Association class; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pain; peripheral neuropathy; phase 2 clinical trial; positron emission tomography; progesterone receptor positive breast cancer; skin disease; stomatitis; thrombocytopenia; thromboembolism; treatment withdrawal; tumor volume; whole body CT; adverse event; breast tumor; clinical trial; heart left ventricle function; heart stroke volume; neoadjuvant therapy; pathology","L.

Anthracyclines are associated with myocardial functional and morphological changes. LVEF is currently used to identify the functional changes. Anthracyclines can also cause myocardial inflammation and oedema. This can be assessed using CMR relaxometry techniques; T1 and T2 mapping and extracellular volume (ECV) fraction. Methods Three databases were systematically searched for studies evaluating CMR relaxometry parameter at baseline and 1±1 months after anthracycline completion (the last search date 17 March 2023). CMR parameters pre and post anthracycline-based chemotherapy were abstracted. A random effects model was used to pool mean difference (MD) in LVEF and ECV. Standardised mean difference (SMD) was also calculated for T1 and T2 mapping due to the variations in techniques, normal ranges and for the comparison among the parameters. Results A total of 296 patients were included from 10 studies. 84% were female with a mean age of 54.9 years. Statistically significant alterations were observed in LVEF (MD -3.38% (95% CI -5.13%, -1.62%)) and ECV (1.92% (1.30%, 2.53%)). The pooled SMDs were also significant in LVEF, T1, T2 and ECV with -0.61 (-0.91, -0.30), 0.53 (0.16, 0.90), 0.59 (0.22, 0.96) and 0.74 (0.41, 1.06), respectively. Conclusions Our meta-analysis demonstrated small but significant alterations in CMR relaxometry parameters soon after anthracycline therapy, where ECV was superior to LVEF and T1 or T2 mapping. However, these short-term MDs were below the minimal detectable differences. PROSPERO registration number CRD42020196296. © 2018 Oxford University Press.

Methods: A total of 65 HER2-positive breast cancer patients receiving NAT were analyzed. The concentration of serum miR-222-3p was detected by quantitative real-time PCR. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the association of serum miR-222-3p with pathological complete response (pCR). The relationship of serum miR-222-3p with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) was examined via log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards analysis. The ordered logistic regression was applied to evaluate the association between serum miR-222-3p and adverse events. Results: The miR-222-3p low group was more likely to achieve pCR [odds ratio (OR) = 0.258, P = 0.043]. The interaction between miR-222-3p and presenting Ki67 level was also detected for pCR (OR = 49.230, Pinteraction = 0.025). The miR-222-3p low group was correlated with superior DFS (P = 0.029) and OS (P = 0.0037). The expression of serum miR-222-3p was the independent protective factor for trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity (P < 0.05) and anemia (P = 0.013). Conclusions: Serum miR-222-3p is the potential factor to predict pCR, survival benefit and trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity for HER2-positive breast cancer patients receiving NAT. © Copyright © 2020 Zhang, Wang, Wang, Peng, Yuan, Zhou, Xu, Lin, Du, Yang, Zhang, Dai, Yin and Lu.","adverse event; breast cancer; neoadjuvant therapy; predictive; prognostic; serum miR-222-3p","alanine aminotransferase; alkaline phosphatase; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; cisplatin; creatinine; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; estrogen receptor; gonadorelin agonist; hormone receptor; Ki 67 antigen; letrozole; microRNA 222; microRNA 222 3p; paclitaxel; progesterone receptor; trastuzumab; unclassified drug; adjuvant therapy; adult; aged; alopecia; anemia; Article; cancer hormone therapy; cancer staging; cardiotoxicity; clinical outcome; clinical trial (topic); constipation; diarrhea; disease free survival; echography; fatigue; female; fluorescence in situ hybridization; gene expression; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; human; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive breast cancer; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; leukemia; loading drug dose; major clinical study; multiple cycle treatment; nausea; needle biopsy; neoadjuvant therapy; neutropenia; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; overall survival; peripheral neuropathy; postmenopause; real time polymerase chain reaction; survival analysis; thrombocytopenia; vomiting","W.

A phase I study was initiated to evaluate the toxicity, MTD, PK, and antitumor activity of RC48 in patients with HER2-overexpressing locally advanced or metastatic solid carcinomas, particularly gastric cancer. Patients and methods: This was a 2-part phase I study. Successive cohorts of patients received escalating doses of RC48 (0.1 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg, and 3.0 mg/kg). Dose expansion proceeded at the dose of 2.0 mg/kg Q2W. The efficacy and safety set included all patients who received at least one dose of RC48. Results: Fifty-seven patients were enrolled, the MTD was unavailable due to termination of 3.0 mg/kg cohort; 2.5 mg/kg Q2W was declared the RP2D. RC48 was well tolerated, the most frequent grade 3 or worse TRAEs included neutropenia (19.3%), leukopenia (17.5%), hypoesthesia (14.0%), and increased conjugated blood bilirubin (8.8%). Four deaths occurred during the whole study, three of which were believed to be related to RC48. Overall, ORR and DCR were 21.0% (12/57) and 49.1% (28/57). Notably, patients who were HER2 IHC2+/FISH- responded similarly to those who were IHC2+/FISH+ and IHC3+, with ORRs of 35.7% (5/14), 20% (2/10), and 13.6% (3/22), respectively. In patients who were pretreated with HER2-targeted drugs, RC48 also showed promising efficacy, with ORR of 15.0% (3/20) and DCR of 45.0% (9/20). Conclusion: RC48 was well tolerated and showed promising antitumor activity in HER2-positive solid tumors, including gastric cancer with HER2 IHC 2+/FISH- status.

The most common reported toxicity is myelosuppression due to disease such as leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. Other toxicities associated with CDK 4/6 inhibitors include mucositis, fatigue, gastrointestinal side effects, hepatic toxicities, and QTc prolongation. Despite a good toxicity profile in pivotal studies, the increased rates of use in clinical practice may show less prevalent but lethal toxicity such as lung injury. Case Presentation: Here, we describe a female patient with metastatic hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor 2-negative breast cancer who developed lung toxicity while on ribociclib. Discussion: Lung injury is a possible side effect of CDK 4/6 inhibitors and there is an increasing need to understand the management of this side effect.  © 2020 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Background: Serum biomarkers of cardiac dysfunction, although elevated after chemotherapy, lack specificity for the mechanism of myocardial tissue alterations. Methods: A total of 27 women with breast cancer (mean age 51.8 ± 8.9 years, mean body mass index 26.9 ± 3.6 kg/m2), underwent cardiac magnetic resonance before and up to 3 times after anthracycline therapy. Cardiac magnetic resonance variables were LV ejection fraction, normalized T2-weighted signal intensity for myocardial edema, extracellular volume (ECV), LV cardiomyocyte mass, intracellular water lifetime (τic; a marker of cardiomyocyte size), and late gadolinium enhancement. Results: At baseline, patients had a relatively low (10-year) Framingham cardiovascular event risk (median 5%), normal LV ejection fractions (mean 69.4 ± 3.6%), and normal LV mass index (51.4 ± 8.0 g/m2), a mean ECV of 0.32 ± 0.038, mean τic of 169 ± 69 ms, and no late gadolinium enhancement. At 351 to 700 days after anthracycline therapy (240 mg/m2), mean LV ejection fraction had declined by 12% to 58 ± 6% (p < 0.001) and mean LV mass index by 19 g/m2 to 36 ± 6 g/m2 (p < 0.001), and mean ECV had increased by 0.037 to 0.36 ± 0.04 (p = 0.004), while mean τic had decreased by 62 ms to 119 ± 54 ms (p = 0.004). Myocardial edema peaked at about 146 to 231 days (p < 0.001). LV mass index was associated with τic (β = 4.1 ± 1.5 g/m2 per 100-ms increase in τic, p = 0.007) but not with ECV. Cardiac troponin T (mean 4.6 ± 1.4 pg/ml at baseline) increased significantly after anthracycline treatment (p < 0.001). Total LV cardiomyocyte mass, estimated as: (1 − ECV) × LV mass, declined more rapidly after anthracycline therapy, with peak cardiac troponin T >10 pg/ml. There was no evidence for any significant interaction between 10-year cardiovascular event risk and the effect of anthracycline therapy. Conclusions: A decrease in LV mass after anthracycline therapy may result from cardiomyocyte atrophy, demonstrating that mechanisms other than interstitial fibrosis and edema can raise ECV. The loss of LV cardiomyocyte mass increased with the degree of cardiomyocyte injury, assessed by peak cardiac troponin T after anthracycline treatment.

Meanwhile, by interfering with the protective effects of neuregulin-1/HER2 signaling on stressed cardio-myocytes, anti-HER2 therapy occasionally induces reversible cancer therapeutics-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD). Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) parametric mapping or myocardial feature-tracking, in combina-tion with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging, has the potential to detect changes in the myocardium in anti-HER2 therapy-related cardiac dysfunction. Here we report a breast cancer patient who experienced life-threatening CTRCD after treatment with trastuzumab plus pertuzumab. This case showed multiple transmural LGE-positive myocardial lesions in CMR imaging and high native T1 and T2 values in CMR parametric map-ping, which was apparently more extensive than those observed in most patients with anti-HER2 therapy-related cardiac dysfunction. Consistent with profound myocardial damage indicated by CMR, her cardiac function was not fully restored despite intensive care and cardioprotective drug therapy. These findings suggest the potential usefulness of LGE imaging and parametric mapping by CMR for the assessment of myocardial injury to deter-mine the clinical severity of anti-HER2 therapy-related cardiac dysfunction. © 2021, International Heart Journal Association.

Based on the observed values, we aimed to evaluate the cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines in cancer patients and to analyze the consistency of the two examination methods in assessing left ventricular function after chemotherapy. Methods: From January 2020 to January 2022, the data of 80 patients with malignant tumors who received anthracycline chemotherapy (breast cancer, n = 40; gastric cancer, n = 40) and 40 healthy volunteers (Control group) were retrospectively collected. Serum high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) levels were detected by an automatic immunoassay analyzer. Left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were measured by cardiac MRI and 2-dimensional ECHO using the biplane Simpson’s method. Results: Compared with baseline values, serum high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) levels were significantly increased in patients with breast cancer and gastric cancer after 6 cycles of chemotherapy (P < 0.05). In addition, LVEDV, LVESV and LVEF measured with MRI were higher than those detected by ECHO in cancer patients after 6 cycles of chemotherapy (P < 0.05). And the Bland-Altman plot analysis showed that LVEDV, LVESV and LVEF measured by the two examination methods were in good agreement. Conclusion: Breast and gastric cancer patients exhibited elevated levels of hs-cTnT after 6 cycles of chemotherapy, indicating potential cardiotoxicity. Additionally, cardiac MRI and 2-dimensional ECHO showed good agreement in assessing left ventricular function, with ECHO tending to underestimate volume measurements compared to MRI. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging; Cardiotoxicity; Chemotherapy; Echocardiography; Left ventricular function","Anthracyclines; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; Breast Neoplasms; Cardiotoxicity; Echocardiography; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Polyketides; Retrospective Studies; Stomach Neoplasms; Stroke Volume; Troponin T; Ventricular Function, Left; anthracycline; cisplatin; cyclophosphamide; docetaxel; epirubicin; fluorouracil; folinate calcium; troponin T; anthracycline; antineoplastic antibiotic; polyketide; troponin T; adult; aged; Article; breast cancer; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; continuous infusion; controlled study; echocardiography; female; heart function; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle enddiastolic volume; heart left ventricle endsystolic volume; heart left ventricle function; human; major clinical study; malignant neoplasm; multiple cycle treatment; protein blood level; retrospective study; stomach cancer; breast tumor; diagnostic imaging; echocardiography; heart left ventricle function; heart stroke volume; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; stomach tumor","Y.-Q.

Recent advances in systemic and local treatments have significantly improved survival rates of patients having early breast cancer. In the last decade, great attention has been paid to the prevention and early detection of cardiotoxicity induced by breast cancer treatments. Systemic therapy-related cardiac toxicities have been extensively studied. Radiotherapy, an essential component of breast cancer treatment, can also increase the risk of heart diseases. Consequently, it is important to balance the expected benefits of cancer treatment with cardiovascular risk and to identify strategies to prevent cardiotoxicity and improve long-term outcomes and quality of life for these patients. Objective: This CardioTox Breast study aims to investigate the use of cardiac imaging, based on cardiac magnetic resonance and echocardiography, and to identify associated circulating biomarkers to assess early tissue changes in chemo-induced and radiation-induced cardiotoxicity in the time window of 12 months after the end of radiotherapy in patients with breast cancer. Methods: The CardioTox Breast trial is a multicenter observational prospective longitudinal study. We aim to enroll 150 women with stage I-III unilateral breast cancer, treated with breast conserving surgery, who planned to receive radiotherapy with or without systemic therapy. Baseline and follow-up data include cardiac measurements based on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiography, and circulating biomarkers of cardiac toxicity. Results: This study details the protocol of the CardioTox Breast trial. Recruitment started in September 2020. The results of this study will not be published until data are mature for the final analysis of the primary study end point. Conclusions: The CardioTox Breast study is designed to investigate the effects of systemic and radiation therapy on myocardial function and structure, thus providing additional evidence on whether cardiac magnetic resonance is the optimal screening imaging for cardiotoxicity. © Giulia Borgonovo, Elen Vettus, Alessandra Greco, Laura Anna Leo, Francesco Fulvio Faletra, Catherine Klersy, Moreno Curti, Mariacarla Valli.","breast cancer; cardiac diagnostic imaging; cardiotoxicity; chemotherapy; radiotherapy","","M.

Clinically, statin use is associated with a lower risk for heart failure in breast cancer patients with anthracycline chemotherapy. So, the purpose of our study was to investigate whether survivin mediates the protective effect of statin against anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. Methods: Mice were treated once a week with 5 mg/kg doxorubicin for 4 weeks with or without atorvastatin 20 mg/kg every day then heart tissues were analyzed. Molecular and cellular biology analyses were performed with H9c2 cell lysates. Results: Doxorubicin suppressed survivin expression via activation of FOXO1 in H9c2 cardiomyocytes. Whereas, atorvastatin inhibited FOXO1 by increasing phosphorylation and inhibiting nuclear localization. Doxorubicin induced FOXO1 binding to STAT3 and prevented STAT3 from interacting with Sp1. However, atorvastatin inhibited these interactions and stabilized STAT3/Sp1 transcription complex. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that doxorubicin decreased STAT3/Sp1 complex binding to survivin promoter, whereas atorvastatin stabilized this binding. In mouse model, atorvastatin rescued doxorubicin-induced reduction of survivin expression and of heart function measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Conclusions: Our study suggested a new pathophysiologic mechanism that survivin mediated protective effect of atorvastatin against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity via FOXO1/STAT3/Sp1 transcriptional network. © 2019","Apoptosis; Cardiotoxicity; Statin","Animals; Atorvastatin; Cardiotonic Agents; Cell Line; Cell Nucleus; Cytoprotection; Disease Models, Animal; Doxorubicin; Forkhead Box Protein O1; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Myocytes, Cardiac; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Protein Transport; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Rats; Signal Transduction; Sp1 Transcription Factor; Survivin; Transcription, Genetic; Transcriptional Activation; atorvastatin; doxorubicin; STAT3 protein; survivin; transcription factor FKHR; transcription factor Sp1; atorvastatin; Birc5 protein, mouse; cardiotonic agent; doxorubicin; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; survivin; transcription factor FKHR; transcription factor Sp1; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cardiac muscle cell; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; cell protection; chromatin immunoprecipitation; confocal microscopy; controlled study; cytology; cytotoxicity; drug inhibition; H9c2(2-1) cell line; heart function; heart tissue; immunoblotting; immunofluorescence; molecular biology; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein binding; protein expression; protein localization; protein phosphorylation; protein protein interaction; protein stability; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; animal; C57BL mouse; cardiac muscle cell; cell line; cell nucleus; disease model; drug effect; genetic transcription; male; metabolism; pathology; protein transport; rat; signal transduction; transcription initiation","S.-M.

Herein, we constructed novel organic dopamine–melanin nanoparticles (dMNs) as a carrier and then surface-loaded them with trastuzumab to construct a multifunctional nanoprobe named Her-PEG-dMNPs. We used micro-PET/CT and PET/MRI multimodality imaging to evaluate the retention effect of the nanoprobe in HER2 expression in gastric cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mice models after labeling of the radionuclides 64Cu or 124I and MRI contrast agent Mn2+. The nanoprobes can specifically target the HER2-expressing SKOV-3 cells in vitro (3.61 ± 0.74 vs. 1.24 ± 0.43 for 2 h, P = 0.002). In vivo, micro-PET/CT and PET/MRI showed that the 124I-labeled nanoprobe had greater contrast and retention effect in PDX models than unloaded dMNPs as carrier (1.63 ± 0.07 vs. 0.90 ± 0.04 at 24 h, P = 0.002), a similarity found in 64Cu-labeled Her-PEG-dMNPs. Because 124I has a longer half-life and matches the pharmacokinetics of the nanoparticles, we focused on the further evaluation of 124I-Her-PEG-dMNPs. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry staining confirmed the overexpression of HER2 in the animal model. This study developed and validated novel HER2-specific multimodality imaging nanoprobes for quantifying HER2 expression in mice. Through the strong retention effect of the tumor site, it can be used for the promotion of monoclonal antibody treatment effect and process monitoring.

We conducted a prospective study using cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to evaluate heart motion. We hypothesized that cine MRI could be used to define population-based cardiac planning organ-at-risk volumes (PRV). Methods and Materials: A total of 16 real-time acquisitions were obtained per subject on a 1.5 Tesla MRI (Philips Ingenia). Planar cine MRI was performed in 4 sequential sagittal and coronal planes at free-breathing (FB) and deep-inspiratory breath hold (DIBH). In-plane cardiac motion was assessed using a scale-invariant feature transformation–based algorithm. Subject-specific pixel motion ranges were defined in anteroposterior (AP), left-right (LR), and superoinferior (SI) planes. Averages of the 98% and 67% of the maximum ranges of pixel displacement were defined by subject, then averaged across the cohort to calculate PRV expansions at FB and DIBH. Results: Data from 20 subjects with a total of 3120 image frames collected per subject in coronal and sagittal planes at DIBH and FB, and 62,400 total frames were analyzed. Cohort averages of 98% of the maximum cardiac motion ranges comprised margin expansions of 12.5 ± 1.1 mm SI, 5.8 ± 1.2 mm AP, and 6.6 ± 1.0 mm LR at FB and 6.7 ± 1.5 mm SI, 4.7 ± 1.3 mm AP, and 5.3 ± 1.3 mm LR at DIBH. Margins for 67% of the maximum range comprised 7.7 ± 0.7 mm SI, 3.2 ± 0.6 mm AP, and 3.7 ± 0.6 mm LR at FB and 4.1 ± 0.9 mm SI, 2.7 ± 0.8 mm AP, and 3.2 ± 0.8 mm LR at DIBH. Subsequently, these margins were simplified to form PRVs for treatment planning. Conclusions: We implemented scale-invariant feature transformation-based motion tracking for analysis of the cardiac cine MRI scans to quantify motion and create cohort-based cardiac PRVs to improve cardioprotection in breast and thoracic radiation. © 2018 American Society for Radiation Oncology","","Adult; Aged; Algorithms; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Heart; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Middle Aged; Organ Sparing Treatments; Organs at Risk; Prospective Studies; Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted; Respiration; adult; aged; Article; breast cancer; breathing exercise; cancer radiotherapy; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; four dimensional computed tomography; heart movement; heart protection; human; image analysis; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; planning target volume; priority journal; real time magnetic resonance imaging; treatment planning; young adult; algorithm; breast tumor; breathing; conservative treatment; diagnostic imaging; heart; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; organs at risk; procedures; prospective study; radiation response; radiotherapy planning system","M.A. Thomas; Department of Radiation Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Campus Box 8224, 4921 Parkview Place, Floor LL, 63110, United States; email: mariathomas@wustl.edu","","Elsevier Inc.","18798500","","","30576844","English","Pract.

However, pertuzumab is not available because it is not on the market or covered by medicare in some regions or poor economy. Anthracyclines and taxanes are cornerstones in BC chemotherapy, and their combination contributes to satisfactory efficiency in neoadjuvant settings. Nonetheless, concomitant administration of trastuzumab and an anthracycline is generally avoided clinically due to cardiotoxicity. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) is less cardiotoxic compared with traditional anthracyclines. Here, we conducted this prospective study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and potential biomarkers for PLD plus trastuzumab and docetaxel as neoadjuvant treatment in HER2-positive BC. Patients and Methods: Patients with stage II or III HER2-positive BC were recruited in this multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase II study. Eligible patients were given 6 cycles of PLD plus docetaxel and trastuzumab. Primary endpoint was total pathological complete response (tpCR, ypT0/is ypN0). Secondary endpoints were breast pathological complete response (bpCR, ypT0/is), objective response rate (ORR), operation rate, breast-conserving surgery rate, and safety. Metadherin (MTDH), glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase (QPCT), topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A), programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were evaluated in BC tissues pre-neoadjuvant for potential biomarkers. Results: Between March 2019 and February 2021, 54 patients were enrolled, 50 were included in the analysis, and 35 (70.0%) completed 6 cycles of neoadjuvant treatment. Forty-nine (98.0%) patients underwent surgery with a breast-conserving rate of 44.0%. The tpCR rate, bpCR rate, and ORR were 48.0% (95% CI, 33.7%–62.6%), 60.0% (95% CI, 45.2%–73.6%), and 84.0% (95% CI, 70.9%–92.8%), respectively. tpCR was associated with MTDH (p = 0.002) and QPCT (p = 0.036) expression but not with TOP2A (p = 0.75), PD-L1 (p = 0.155), or TILs (p = 0.76). Patients with HR-negative status were more likely to achieve bpCR compared with those with HR-positive status (76.2% vs. 48.3%, p = 0.047). Grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in 38.0% of patients. Left ventricular ejection fraction decline by ≥10% was reported in 18.0% of patients, and no patient experienced congestive heart failure. Conclusions: PLD plus docetaxel and trastuzumab might be a potential neoadjuvant regimen for HER2-positive BC with a high tpCR rate and manageable tolerability. MTDH and QPCT are potential predictive markers for tpCR.

We conducted a prospective, multi-centre, longitudinal observational study of 41 trastuzumab-treated breast cancer women who underwent serial CMR (baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months). Two blinded readers independently measured left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), peak systolic strain parameters (global longitudinal strain [GLS] and global circumferential strain [GCS]), and early diastolic strain rate parameters (global longitudinal diastolic strain rate [GLSR-E], global circumferential diastolic strain rate [GCSR-E], and global radial diastolic strain rate [GRSR-E]), by feature tracking (FT-CMR) using CMR42. There was a significant decline in peak systolic strain GLS and GCS at 6 months (p = 0.024 and p < 0.001, respectively) and 12 months (p = 0.002 and p < 0.001, respectively), followed by recovery at 18 months, which paralleled decline in LVEF at 6 months (p = 0.034) and 12 months (p = 0.012). Conversely, early diastolic strain rates GLSR-E and GCSR-E did not significantly change over 18 months (p > 0.10), while GRSR-E was marginally significant at 12 months (p = 0.021). There was no significant correlation between changes at 6 months in LVEF and GLSR-E or GRSR-E (p > 0.10), and a marginally significant weak correlation between LVEF and GCSR-E (p = 0.046). Among trastuzumab-treated patients without overt cardiotoxicity, there was no consistent temporal change in FT-CMR-derived diastolic strain rate parameters up to 18 months, in contrast to decline in systolic strain and LVEF. Systolic strains by FT-CMR are likely more useful than diastolic strain rates for monitoring subclinical trastuzumab-related myocardial dysfunction.

Using a new software algorithm, we sought to determine in individuals receiving treatment for cancer the association between automated assessments of LV mean mid-wall circumferential strain and conventional measures of LV ejection fraction (EF) both obtained from cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) cine balanced steady-state free-precession (bSSFP) white-blood acquisitions. Methods: Before and 3 months after initiating treatment with potentially cardio-toxic chemotherapy, 72 individuals (aged 54 ± 14 years with breast cancer [39%], lymphoma [49%], or sarcoma [12%]) underwent serial CMR cine bSSFP assessments of LV volumes and EF, and mean mid-wall circumferential strain determined from these same cine images as well as from additional tagged CMR images. On the cine images, assessments of strain were obtained using the newly developed deformation-based segmentation algorithm. Assessments of LV volumes/EF from the cine images and strain from tagged CMR were accomplished using commercially available software. All measures were analyzed in a blinded fashion independent of one another. Results: Acceptable measures for the automated assessments of mean mid-wall circumferential strain from the cine images were obtained in 142 of 144 visits (98.6%) with an overall analysis time averaging 6:47 ± 1:06 min. The results from these automated measures averaged -18.8 ± 2.9 at baseline and -17.6 ± 3.1 at 3 months (p = 0.001). Left ventricular EF declined slightly from 65 ± 7% at baseline to 62 ± 7% at 3 months (p = 0.0002). The correlation between strain from cine imaging and LVEF was r = -0.61 (p < 0.0001). In addition, the 3-month changes in LV strain and LVEF were correlated (r = -0.49; p < 0.0001). The correlation between cine and tagged derived assessments of strain was r = 0.23; p = 0.01. Conclusions: Automated measures of LV mean mid-wall circumferential strain can be obtained in 6-34; minutes from cine bSSFP LV short-axis images (used concurrently to assess LV volumes and EF) in 98.6% of patients receiving treatment for cancer with potentially cardio-toxic chemotherapy. These cine derived measures of circumferential strain correlate with early subclinical declines in LVEF. © 2017 The Author(s).","Cancer therapy cardiotoxicity; Cardiovascular magnetic resonance; Chemotherapy; Strain","Adult; Aged; Algorithms; Antineoplastic Agents; Automation; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cardiotoxicity; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; Stress, Mechanical; Stroke Volume; Time Factors; Ventricular Dysfunction, Left; Ventricular Function, Left; alkylating agent; anthracycline; antineoplastic antimetabolite; protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor; antineoplastic agent; adult; algorithm; Article; breast cancer; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; cardiovascular parameters; cine magnetic resonance imaging; circumferential strain; female; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle volume; human; image analysis; lymphoma; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; priority journal; sarcoma; software; aged; automation; biomechanics; cardiotoxicity; chemically induced; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; drug effects; feasibility study; heart left ventricle function; heart stroke volume; mechanical stress; middle aged; neoplasm; pathophysiology; predictive value; prospective study; time factor","W.G.

Background Cancer survivors who receive Anth-bC experience premature CV events. It is unknown whether low to moderate doses of anthracyclines promote early subclinical CV disease manifested by deteriorations in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or increases in aortic stiffness, or if these doses are associated with changes in quality of life (QOL). Methods In 53 men and women with breast cancer, leukemia, or lymphoma, we assessed left ventricular volumes, LVEF, circumferential strain, aortic pulse wave velocity, late gadolinium enhancement, serum B-type natriuretic peptide, troponin I, and the impact of treatment on QOL before and 1, 3, and 6 months after receipt of Anth-bC. Results Participants averaged 50 ± 2 (range 19 to 80) years in age, 58% were women, 17% were black, and they each received a range of 50 to 375 mg/m2 of doxorubicin-equivalent chemotherapy. Left ventricular end-systolic volume (48 ± 3 ml to 54 ± 3 ml; p = 0.02), left ventricular strain (-17.7 ± 0.4 to -15.1 ± 0.4; p = 0.0003), pulse wave velocity (6.7 ± 0.5 m/s to 10.1 ± 1 m/s; p = 0.0006), and QOL deterioration (15.4 ± 3.3 to 28.5 ± 3.9; p = 0.008) increased, whereas LVEF (58 ± 1% to 53 ± 1%; p = 0.0002) decreased within 6 months after low to moderate doses of Anth-bC. All findings persisted after accounting for age, gender, race (white/black), doxorubicin-equivalent dose, doxorubicin administration technique, comorbidities associated with CV events, and cancer diagnosis (p = 0.02 to 0.0001 for all). There were no new late gadolinium enhancement findings after 6 months. Conclusions In these study patients, low to moderate doses of Anth-bC were associated with the early development of subclinical abnormalities of cardiac and vascular function that in other populations are associated with the future occurrence of CV events. © 2013 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.","cardio-oncology; cardiotoxicity; chemotherapy","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anthracyclines; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; Biological Markers; Breast Neoplasms; Cardiovascular Diseases; Female; Humans; Leukemia; Lymphoma; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Natriuretic Peptide, Brain; Predictive Value of Tests; Pulse Wave Analysis; Quality of Life; Questionnaires; Risk Factors; Stroke Volume; Time Factors; Troponin I; Vascular Stiffness; Ventricular Function, Left; Young Adult; Anth-bC; anthracycline-based chemotherapy; B-type natriuretic peptide; BNP; cardiac magnetic resonance; cardio-oncology; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular; chemotherapy; CMR; CV; echo time; left ventricular ejection fraction; left ventricular end-diastolic volume; left ventricular end-systolic volume; LVEDV; LVEF; LVESV; Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire; MLHFQ; pulse wave velocity; PWV; QOL; quality of life; repetition time; TE; TnI; TR; troponin I; angiotensin receptor antagonist; anthracycline; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; brain natriuretic peptide; calcium antagonist; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; diuretic agent; doxorubicin; gadolinium; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; troponin I; vasodilator agent; adult; aged; aortic pulse wave velocity; article; breast cancer; cancer chemotherapy; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular parameters; circumferential strain; female; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle volume; human; leukemia; lymphoma; major clinical study; male; priority journal; pulse wave; quality of life","W.G.

The objective of this study was to compare the accuracy of left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEF) obtained by contemporary clinical multiple gated acquisition scans (MUGA) with reference LVEFs from cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in consecutive patients with cancer. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, we compared MUGA clinical and CMR reference LVEFs in 75 patients with cancer who had both studies within 30 days. Misclassification was assessed using the two most common thresholds of LVEF used in cardiotoxicity clinical studies and practice: 50 and 55%. Results: Compared to CMR reference LVEFs, MUGA clinical LVEFs were only lower by a mean of 1.5% (48.5% vs. 50.0%, p = 0.17). However, the limits of agreement between MUGA clinical and CMR reference LVEFs were wide at -19.4 to 16.5%. At LVEF thresholds of 50 and 55%, there was misclassification of 35 and 20% of cancer patients, respectively. Conclusions: MUGA clinical LVEFs are only modestly accurate when compared with CMR reference LVEFs. These data have significant implications on clinical research and patient care of a population with, or at risk for, cardiotoxicity. © 2017 The Author(s).","Cancer; Cardio-oncology; Cardiovascular magnetic resonance; Ejection fraction; MUGA; Onco-cardiology","Aged; Antineoplastic Agents; Cardiac-Gated Imaging Techniques; Cardiotoxicity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Heart Diseases; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Predictive Value of Tests; Radionuclide Imaging; Reproducibility of Results; Stroke Volume; Time Factors; Ventricular Function, Left; antineoplastic agent; adult; Article; breast cancer; cardiac imaging; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; cross-sectional study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; disease classification; false negative result; false positive result; female; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle volume; human; intermethod comparison; leukemia; lymphoma; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; multiple gated acquisition scanning; multiple myeloma; myelodysplastic syndrome; predictive value; retrospective study; sarcoma; sensitivity and specificity; aged; cardiac gated imaging; cardiotoxicity; chemically induced; cine magnetic resonance imaging; comparative study; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; drug effects; heart disease; heart left ventricle function; heart stroke volume; middle aged; neoplasm; pathophysiology; procedures; reproducibility; scintiscanning; time factor","C.

Cardiotoxic effects of chemotherapy are an increasing concern. To effectively interpret cardiac imaging studies performed for screening purposes in patients undergoing cancer therapy it is necessary to understand the normal changes in structure and function that may occur. Methods: Twenty women without preexisting cardiovascular disease, of a mean age of 50 years, newly diagnosed with nonmetastatic breast cancer and treated with anthracycline or trastuzumab, were prospectively enrolled and evaluated at four time points (at baseline, during chemotherapy, 2 weeks after chemotherapy, and 6 months after chemotherapy) using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, blood samples, and a clinical questionnaire. Results: Over a 6-month period, the left ventricular ejection fraction (%) decreased (64.15±5.30 to 60.41±5.77, P<0.002) and the LV end-diastolic (mm) and end-systolic (mm) volumes increased (124.73±20.25 to 132.21±19.33, P<0.04 and 45.16±11.88 to 52.57±11.65, P<0.00, respectively). The LV mass (g) did not change (73.06±11.51 to 69.21±15.3, P=0.08), but the LV mass to LVEDV ratio (g/mm) decreased (0.594±0.098 to 0.530±0.124, P<0.04). Conclusions: In low-cardiac-risk women with nonmetastatic breast cancer, the increased LV volume and a mildly decreased left ventricular ejection fraction during and after chemotherapy do not seem to be associated with laboratory or clinical evidence of increased risk for heart failure.

However, conventional anthracyclines are not commonly used in elderly patients or those prone to cardiotoxicity. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, (PLD) has comparable efficacy, but less cardiotoxicity than conventional anthracyclines. We conducted a phase II single-arm trial to assess the efficacy and safety of PCT based on PLD followed by paclitaxel (PTX) in a HRBC population usually undertreated. Fifty patients with stage II–IIIB breast cancer and at least one risk factor for developing cardiotoxicity initiated PLD 35 mg/m2 plus cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 every 4 weeks for four cycles, followed by 80 mg/m2 weekly PTX for 12. Close cardiac monitoring was performed. Primary endpoint was the pathological complete response rate (pCR) in the breast. Treatment delivery and toxicities were assessed. Eighty-four per cent of patients were older than 65 years, 64 % suffered from hypertension, and 10 % had prior cardiac disease. In an intention-to-treat analysis, breast pCR was 32 % (95 % CI 19.5–46.7 %) and pCR in breast and axilla was 24 % (95 % CI 12.1–35.8 %). At diagnosis only, 26 % of patients were candidates for breast conservative surgery, which increased to 58.7 % after PCT. No significant decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction was seen. PLD followed by PTX was feasible in a fragile population of patients who were not candidates for conventional doxorubicin. Moreover, it achieved a pCR similar to standard therapy and could therefore be an option for elderly patients or cardiotoxicity-prone who present HRBC. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Breast cancer; Cardiotoxicity; Elderly; Neoadjuvant chemotherapy; Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin; Phase II study","Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Biomarkers, Tumor; Breast Neoplasms; Cardiotoxicity; Comorbidity; Cyclophosphamide; Doxorubicin; Female; Heart Diseases; Humans; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Paclitaxel; Polyethylene Glycols; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome; aromatase inhibitor; cyclophosphamide; doxorubicin; paclitaxel; tamoxifen; trastuzumab; antineoplastic agent; cyclophosphamide; doxorubicin; macrogol derivative; paclitaxel; tumor marker; adult; aged; alopecia; anemia; anorexia; Article; bleeding; breast cancer; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer staging; cancer surgery; cardiotoxicity; constipation; controlled study; coronary artery disease; diarrhea; disease severity; drug blood level; drug efficacy; drug half life; drug safety; drug tolerability; echomammography; edema; elderly care; electrocardiography; fatigue; female; fever; hand foot syndrome; heart disease; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; hemolysis; human; human tissue; hypersensitivity; hypertension; infection; Karnofsky Performance Status; kidney failure; lung disease; major clinical study; mammography; middle aged; multicenter study; multiple cycle treatment; nail disease; nausea; neurologic disease; neutropenia; New York Heart Association class; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pain; phase 2 clinical trial; priority journal; progression free survival; questionnaire; rash; recommended drug dose; risk assessment; risk factor; stomatitis; thrombocytopenia; treatment response; very elderly; vomiting; age; analogs and derivatives; Breast Neoplasms; cardiotoxicity; clinical trial; comorbidity; Heart Diseases; metabolism; pathology; pathophysiology; treatment outcome","","","Springer New York LLC","01676806","","BCTRD","25981896","English","Breast Cancer Res.

We sought to determine whether T1- and T2-weighted measures of signal intensity associate with decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction in human subjects receiving potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy. Methods and Results: In 65 individuals with breast cancer (n=51) or a hematologic malignancy (n=14), we measured left ventricular volumes, ejection fraction, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted and T2-weighted signal intensity before and 3 months after initiating potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy using blinded, unpaired analysis of cardiovascular magnetic resonance images. Participants were aged 51±12 years, of whom 55% received an anthracycline, 38% received a monoclonal antibody, and 6% received an antimicrotubule agent. Overall, left ventricular ejection fraction decreased from 57±6% to 54±7% (P<0.001) because of an increase in end-systolic volume (P<0.05). T1-weighted signal intensities also increased from 14.1±5.1 to 15.9±6.8 (P<0.05), with baseline values trending higher among individuals who received chemotherapy before study enrollment (P=0.06). Changes in T1-weighted signal intensity did not differ within the 17 LV myocardial segments (P=0.97). Myocardial edema quantified from T2-weighted images did not change significantly after 3 months (P=0.70). Conclusions: Concordant with previous animal studies, cardiovascular magnetic resonance measures of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted signal intensity occur commensurate with small but significant left ventricular ejection fraction declines 3 months after the receipt of potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy. These data indicate that changes in T1-weighted signal intensity may serve as an early marker of subclinical injury related to the administration of potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy in human subjects. © 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.","Anthracyclines; Cardiotoxicity; Chemotherapy; Left ventricular function; Magnetic resonance imaging","Adult; Anthracyclines; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Breast Neoplasms; Edema, Cardiac; Female; Heart Ventricles; Hematologic Neoplasms; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; Stroke Volume; Time Factors; Tubulin Modulators; Ventricular Dysfunction, Left; Ventricular Function, Left; bevacizumab; daunorubicin; docetaxel; doxorubicin; epirubicin; gemtuzumab; paclitaxel; trastuzumab; anthracycline; antineoplastic antibiotic; monoclonal antibody; tubulin modulator; adult; Article; breast cancer; cancer chemotherapy; cancer radiotherapy; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; female; glomerulus filtration rate; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle volume; hematologic malignancy; human; major clinical study; male; measurement; outcome assessment; patient history of chemotherapy; priority journal; susceptibility weighted imaging; Breast Neoplasms; chemically induced; drug effects; heart edema; heart left ventricle function; heart stroke volume; heart ventricle; Hematologic Neoplasms; longitudinal study; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; pathophysiology; predictive value; prospective study; time","W.G.

Radionuclide angiography (RNA) is often used; however, a typical monitoring schedule could include 5 scans in a year. We evaluated the proportion of imaging-related ionizing radiation attributable to RNA in 115 patients with breast cancer, from 3 medical centers in the United States, Ireland, and Japan, who completed 12 months of trastuzumab treatment. Estimated radiation dose (ERD) was used to calculate exposure associated with imaging procedures spanning the 18 months before and after trastuzumab therapy. In addition, 20 cardiologists and oncologists from participating centers were surveyed for their opinions regarding the contribution of RNA to overall radiation exposure during trastuzumab treatment. When RNA was used to monitor LVEF, the mean ERD from imaging was substantial (34 ± 24.3 mSv), with the majority attributable solely to RNA (24.7 ± 14.8 mSv, 72.6%). Actual ERD associated with RNA in this population differed significantly from the perception in surveyed cardiologists and oncologists; 70% of respondents believed that RNA typically accounted for 0% to 20% of overall radiation exposure from imaging; RNA actually accounted for more than 70% of ERD. In conclusion, RNA was used to monitor LVEF in most patients in this cohort during and after trastuzumab therapy. This significantly increased ERD and accounted for a greater proportion of radiation than that perceived by surveyed physicians. ERD should be taken into account when choosing a method of LVEF surveillance. Alternative techniques that do not use radiation should be strongly considered. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: Following surgical resection, 120 breast cancer patients scheduled for adjuvant epirubicin-containing chemotherapy and, if indicated, trastuzumab, will be included. They will be randomized to an ARB (candesartan), a beta-blocker (metoprolol) and matching placebos in a 2 × 2 factorial design. The primary objective of the PRADA study is to assess whether prophylactic ARB and/or beta-blockers may prevent a reduction in LV ejection fraction (EF) after adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer, as evaluated by serial cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) performed at randomization, after the first chemotherapy cycle and on its completion, and for subgroups, on completion of radiotherapy or trastuzumab. Secondary outcome measures include echocardiographic indices of LV diastolic dysfunction, structural myocardial alterations assessed by CMR and changes in cardiac biomarkers. Conclusion: PRADA may provide new information on the prophylactic effect of ARB and beta-blockers in patients with early breast cancer regarding the risk of developing cardiac dysfunction from adjuvant cancer treatment.

The primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose of this densified regimen. Study of the efficacy was a secondary objective. Her2-negative, hormone-resistant metastatic breast cancer patients were treated with escalating doses of docetaxel plus epirubicin every 2 weeks for six cycles with granulocyte colony stimulating factor support. A total of 16 patients were treated with total doses ranging from 85 to 110 mg of docetaxel plus epirubicin per cycle. Dose escalation was controlled by a non-hematological toxicity model. Dose densification was guided by a model of neutrophil kinetics, able to optimize docetaxel plus epirubicin dosing with respect to pre-defined acceptable levels of hematological toxicity while ensuring maximal efficacy. The densified treatment was safe since hematological toxicity was much lower compared to previous findings, and other adverse events were consistent with those observed with this regimen. The maximal tolerated dose was 100 mg given every 2 weeks. The response rate was 45 %; median progression-free survival was 10.4 months, whereas 54.6 months of median overall survival was achieved. The optimized docetaxel plus epirubicin dosing regimen led to fewer toxicities associated with higher efficacy as compared with standard or empirical densified dosing. This study suggests that model-driven dosage adjustment can lead to improved efficacy-toxicity balance in patients with cancer when several anticancer drugs are combined. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016.","Densification; Dosing regimen optimization; Drug combination; Intensification; PK/PD modeling","Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Breast Neoplasms; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Administration Schedule; Epirubicin; Female; Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor; Humans; Maximum Tolerated Dose; Neoplasm Metastasis; Survival Analysis; Taxoids; Treatment Outcome; docetaxel; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; epirubicin; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; antineoplastic agent; docetaxel; epirubicin; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; taxoid; adult; anemia; Article; asthenia; blood toxicity; cardiotoxicity; clinical article; controlled study; diarrhea; drug dose comparison; drug dose escalation; drug efficacy; drug response; drug safety; drug tolerability; drug withdrawal; edema; febrile neutropenia; female; human; human cell; metastatic breast cancer; mucosa inflammation; multiple cycle treatment; neutropenia; neutrophil; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; onycholysis; overall survival; peripheral neuropathy; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); priority journal; progression free survival; stomatitis; thrombocytopenia; vomiting; x-ray computed tomography; Breast Neoplasms; clinical trial; dose response; drug administration; maximum tolerated dose; metastasis; phase 1 clinical trial; phase 2 clinical trial; survival analysis; treatment outcome","A.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and b-blockers are recommended first-line agents for heart failure. We hypothesized that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and β-blockers could prevent trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity. Patients and Methods In this double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive treatment with perindopril, bisoprolol, or placebo (1:1:1) for the duration of trastuzumab adjuvant therapy. Patients underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and post-cycle 17 for the determination of left ventricular volumes and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Cardiotoxicity was evaluated as the change in indexed left ventricular end diastolic volume and LVEF. Results Thirty-three patients received perindopril, 31 received bisoprolol, and 30 received placebo. Baseline demographic, cancer, and cardiovascular profiles were similar between groups. Study drugs were well tolerated with no serious adverse events. After 17 cycles of trastuzumab, indexed left ventricular end diastolic volume increased in patients treated with perindopril (+7 ± 14 mL/m2), bisoprolol (+8 mL ± 9 mL/m2), and placebo (+4 ± 11 mL/m2; P = .36). In secondary analyses, trastuzumab-mediated decline in LVEF was attenuated in bisoprolol-treated patients (-1 ± 5%) relative to the perindopril (-3 ± 4%) and placebo (-5 ± 5%) groups (P = .001). Perindopril and bisoprolol use were independent predictors of maintained LVEF on multivariable analysis. Conclusion Perindopril and bisoprolol were well tolerated in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer who received trastuzumab and protected against cancer therapy-related declines in LVEF; however, trastuzumab-mediated left ventricular remodeling-the primary outcome-was not prevented by these pharmacotherapies. © 2016 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.","","Adrenergic beta-1 Receptor Antagonists; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Bisoprolol; Breast Neoplasms; Cardiotoxicity; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Middle Aged; Perindopril; Receptor, ErbB-2; Stroke Volume; Trastuzumab; Ventricular Remodeling; bisoprolol; perindopril; placebo; trastuzumab; antineoplastic agent; beta 1 adrenergic receptor blocking agent; bisoprolol; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; ERBB2 protein, human; perindopril; trastuzumab; adjuvant therapy; adult; Article; cancer patient; cancer research; cardiac imaging; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; clinical article; controlled study; demography; double blind procedure; drug use; early cancer; female; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle enddiastolic volume; heart left ventricle volume; human; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive breast cancer; male; middle aged; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; treatment duration; Breast Neoplasms; cardiotoxicity; clinical trial; diagnostic imaging; drug effects; enzymology; heart stroke volume; heart ventricle remodeling; multicenter study; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging","D.I.

Therefore, we sought to evaluate the temporal changes in right ventricular (RV) structure and function as measured by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), and their relationship with left ventricular (LV) structure and function in breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab. Methods: Prospective, longitudinal, observational study involving 41 women with HER2+ breast cancer who underwent serial CMR at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months after initiation of trastuzumab. A single blinded observer measured RV parameters on de-identified CMRs in a random order. Linear mixed models were used to investigate temporal changes in RV parameters. Results: Of the 41 women (age 52 ± 11 years), only one patient experienced trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity. Compared to baseline, there were small but significant increases in the RV end-diastolic volume at 6 months (p = 0.002) and RV end-systolic volume at 6 and 12 months (p < 0.001 for both), but not at 18 months (p = 0.82 and 0.13 respectively). RV ejection fraction (RVEF), when compared to baseline (58.3%, 95% CI 57.1-59.5%), showed corresponding decreases at 6 months (53.9%, 95% CI 52.5-55.4%, p < 0.001) and 12 months (55%, 95% CI 53.8-56.2%, p < 0.001) that recovered at 18 months (56.6%, 95% CI 55.1-58.0%, p = 0.08). Although the temporal pattern of changes in LVEF and RVEF were similar, there was no significant correlation between RVEF and LVEF at baseline (r = 0.29, p = 0.07) or between their changes at 6 months (r = 0.24, p = 0.17). Conclusion: In patients receiving trastuzumab without overt cardiotoxicity, there is a subtle but significant deleterious effect on RV structure and function that recover at 18 months, which can be detected by CMR. Furthermore, monitoring of LVEF alone may not be sufficient in detecting early RV injury. These novel findings provide further support for CMR in monitoring early cardiotoxicity.

One hundred twelve consecutively recruited subjects (aged 52 ± 14 years) with cancer underwent blinded cardiovascular magnetic resonance measurements of LV volumes, mass, and LVEF before and 3 months after initiating potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy (72% of participants received anthracyclines). Twenty-six participants developed important declines in LVEF of >10% or to values <50% at 3 months, in whom 19% versus 60%, respectively, experienced their decline in LVEF due to isolated declines in LVEDV versus an increase in LVESV; participants who dropped their LVEF due to decreases in LVEDV lost more LV mass than those who dropped their LVEF due to an increase in LVESV (p = 0.03). Nearly one fifth of subjects experience marked LVEF declines due to an isolated decline in LVEDV after initiating potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy. Because reductions in intravascular volume (which could be treated by volume repletion) may account for LVEDV-related declines in LVEF, these data indicate that LV volumes should be reviewed along with LVEF when acquiring imaging studies for cardiotoxicity during the treatment for cancer. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","","Antineoplastic Agents; Cardiac Volume; Cardiotoxicity; Diastole; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Prospective Studies; Stroke Volume; Time Factors; Ventricular Dysfunction, Left; Ventricular Function, Left; alkylating agent; anthracycline; antimicrotubule agent; antineoplastic agent; bevacizumab; protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor; rituximab; sunitinib; trastuzumab; unclassified drug; adult; Article; breast cancer; cancer therapy; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; controlled study; female; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle enddiastolic volume; heart left ventricle endsystolic volume; heart left ventricle mass; heart left ventricle volume; human; kidney carcinoma; leukemia; lymphoma; major clinical study; male; priority journal; sarcoma; cardiotoxicity; chemically induced; cine magnetic resonance imaging; diagnosis; diastole; drug effects; follow up; heart left ventricle function; heart stroke volume; heart ventricle; heart volume; middle aged; Neoplasms; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; prospective study; time factor","W.G.

However, cardiotoxicity remains an important side effect. Methods We re-consented node-positive BC patients enrolled in a phase III trial between 1988 and 1996 which compared six cycles of oral cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil (CMF) versus two epirubicin-cyclophosphamide regimens differing by the anthracycline cumulative dose [standard-dose epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (SDE) (8 × 60 mg/m2) and higher-dose epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (HDE) (8 × 100 mg/m2)]. Eligible patients were those who were alive and free of disease and had no contra-indications to the proposed tests (cardiac evaluation). Cardiotoxicity was defined as asymptomatic systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50%, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class I) or symptomatic heart failure (NYHA Class II-IV). Differences in cardiotoxicity between CMF and SDE/HDE were assessed using chi-square and Fisher Exact tests for binary variables and t-test and Wilcoxon test for continuous variables. Results Among the 777 patients, 20 cases of CHF were reported (CMF = 1, SDE = 5, HDE = 14; p < 0.001). Between September 2010 and June 2013, 82 patients (30%) out of 269 eligible patients accepted to participate in this substudy. Median follow-up was 18 years (range 15-24). Epirubicin-treated patients had significantly higher heart rate, more abnormal echocardiograms and LVEF by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compared to CMF-treated ones. A trend towards higher BNP was also observed in the SDE/HDE group (P = 0.08). No differences were observed in LVEF assessed by echocardiogram or troponin T levels. Conclusions Participation rate in this substudy was lower than expected highlighting the complexity of re-calling patients several years after the initial BC diagnosis. After 18 years, epirubicin-treated patients had a lower LVEF by MRI, more abnormal echocardiograms, higher heart rates compared to patients treated with CMF. However, no major delayed cardiotoxicity was observed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Adjuvant therapy; Late cardiac toxicity; Node-positive breast cancer","Adult; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Breast Neoplasms; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Cyclophosphamide; Disease-Free Survival; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Echocardiography; Epirubicin; Female; Fluorouracil; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Failure; Humans; Methotrexate; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Survival Rate; Ventricular Dysfunction, Left; anthracycline; cyclophosphamide; epirubicin; fluorouracil; methotrexate; troponin T; antineoplastic agent; cyclophosphamide; epirubicin; fluorouracil; methotrexate; adult; aged; Article; breast cancer; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer patient; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; drug megadose; early cancer; ECG abnormality; female; heart failure; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart rate; human; major clinical study; multicenter study (topic); multiple cycle treatment; New York Heart Association class; phase 3 clinical trial (topic); priority journal; systolic dysfunction; adjuvant chemotherapy; Breast Neoplasms; chemically induced; clinical trial; controlled study; disease free survival; dose response; echocardiography; echography; follow up; heart failure; heart left ventricle function; middle aged; mortality; multicenter study; outcome assessment; pathophysiology; phase 3 clinical trial; procedures; prognosis; proportional hazards model; randomized controlled trial; statistics and numerical data; survival rate; tumor recurrence","","","Elsevier Ltd","09598049","","EJCAE","26321502","English","Eur.

Women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer are more likely to develop cardiovascular diseases than the general population, in part due to the direct toxic effects of cancer treatment on the cardiovascular system. The aim of this review was to determine the utility of cardiac stress tests for the detection of cardiovascular disease after cardiotoxic breast cancer treatment. Design: Systematic review. Methods: Medline and Embase were searched for studies utilizing heart function tests in breast cancer survivors. Studies utilizing a cardiac stress test and a heart function test performed at rest were included to determine whether stress provided added benefit to identifying cardiac abnormalities that were undetected at rest within each study. Results: Fourteen studies were identified. Overall, there was a benefit to utilizing stress tests over tests at rest in identifying evidence of cardiovascular disease in five studies, a possible benefit in five studies, and no benefit in four studies. The most common type of stress test was myocardial perfusion imaging, where reversible perfusion defects were detected under stress in individuals who had no defects at rest, in five of seven studies of long-term follow-up. Two studies demonstrated the benefit of stress echocardiography over resting echocardiography for detecting left ventricular dysfunction in anthracycline-treated breast cancer survivors. There was no benefit of stress cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in one study. Two studies showed a potential benefit of stress electrocardiography, whereas three others did not. Conclusion: The use of cardiac stress with myocardial perfusion imaging and echocardiography may provide added benefit to tests performed at rest for detection of cardiovascular disease in breast cancer survivors, and merits further research. © 2015 Kirkham et al.","Breast neoplasms; Exercise test; Heart diseases; Heart function tests; Review","anthracycline; Article; breast cancer; cancer survivor; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; disease predisposition; exercise test; follow up; heart function test; heart left ventricle failure; human; intermethod comparison; myocardial perfusion imaging; stress echocardiography; systematic review","","","Dove Medical Press Ltd","11791411","","","","English","Int.

While few of these studies have included subjects aged 65 years and older, it is logical to expect that older patients are at risk of cognitive decline. Here, we use breast cancer as an exemplar disease for inquiry into the intersection of aging and cognitive effects of cancer and its therapies. There are a striking number of common underlying potential biological risks and pathways for the development of cancer, cancer-related cognitive declines, and aging processes, including the development of a frail phenotype. Candidate shared pathways include changes in hormonal milieu, inflammation, oxidative stress, DNA damage and compromised DNA repair, genetic susceptibility, decreased brain blood flow or disruption of the blood-brain barrier, direct neurotoxicity, decreased telomere length, and cell senescence. There also are similar structure and functional changes seen in brain imaging studies of cancer patients and those seen with ""normal"" aging and Alzheimer's disease. Disentangling the role of these overlapping processes is difficult since they require aged animal models and large samples of older human subjects. From what we do know, frailty and its low cognitive reserve seem to be a clinically useful marker of risk for cognitive decline after cancer and its treatments. This and other results from this review suggest the value of geriatric assessments to identify older patients at the highest risk of cognitive decline. Further research is needed to understand the interactions between aging, genetic predisposition, lifestyle factors, and frailty phenotypes to best identify the subgroups of older patients at greatest risk for decline and to develop behavioral and pharmacological interventions targeting this group. We recommend that basic science and population trials be developed specifically for older hosts with intermediate endpoints of relevance to this group, including cognitive function and trajectories of frailty. Clinicians and their older patients can advance the field by active encouragement of and participation in research designed to improve the care and outcomes of the growing population of older cancer patients. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","","Aged; Aging; Antineoplastic Agents; Breast Neoplasms; Cognition; Cognition Disorders; Cognitive Reserve; Female; Frail Elderly; Geriatric Assessment; Humans; androgen; antineoplastic agent; antioxidant; apolipoprotein E; brain derived neurotrophic factor; C reactive protein; catechol methyltransferase; cyclophosphamide; estrogen; estrogen receptor; exemestane; fluorouracil; fluoxetine; interleukin 6; methotrexate; modafinil; multidrug resistance protein 1; nicotine; peptidylprolyl isomerase Pin1; protein p53; serotonin receptor; tamoxifen; tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor; aging; Alzheimer disease; article; attention; behavior disorder; blood brain barrier; brain blood flow; breast cancer; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular function; cognitive defect; cognitive reserve; DNA damage; DNA repair; drug efficacy; executive function; frail elderly; frontal lobe; functional magnetic resonance imaging; genetic predisposition; genetic susceptibility; geriatric assessment; geriatric care; high risk patient; hippocampus; human; inflammation; language; learning; lifestyle; memory; mild cognitive impairment; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; oxidative stress; phenotype; positron emission tomography; priority journal; psychomotor performance; senescence; single nucleotide polymorphism; telomere homeostasis; Wide Range Achievement Test; working memory","J.S.

We prospectively assessed heart changes after 3D conformal RT (3DCRT) and IMRT for left-sided breast cancer. Heart dose was analyzed individually, 3DCRT patients were moderately exposed, and IMRT was performed only in patients with unacceptably high heart doses upon 3DCRT planning. Methods and Materials: In 49 patients (38 patients received 3DCRT; 11 patients received IMRT; and 20 patients received neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and echocardiography were performed before and at 6, 12, and 24 months after treatment. Results: Mean heart dose for IMRT was 12.9 3.9 Gy versus 4.52.4 Gy for 3DCRT. Heart volumes receiving >40 Gy were 2.6% (3DCRT) versus 1.3% (IMRT); doses were >50 Gy only with 3DCRT. Temporary ejection fraction (EF) decrease was observed on MRI after 6 months (63%-59%, PZ.005) resolving at 24 months. Only 3 patients had pronounced largely transient changes of EF and left ventricular enddiastolic diameter (LVEDD). Mitral (M) and tricuspid (T) annular plane systolic excursion (MAPSE and TAPSE) were reduced over the whole cohort (still within normal range). After 24 months left ventricular remodeling index decreased in patients receiving chemotherapy (0.80 vs 0.70, PZ.028). Neither wall motion abnormalities nor late enhancements were found. On echocardiography, in addition to EF findings that were similar to those on MRI, global strain was unchanged over the whole cohort at 24 months after a transient decrease at 6 and 12 months. Longitudinal strain decreased in the whole cohort after 24 months in some segments, whereas it increased in others. Conclusions: Until 24 months after risk-adapted modern multimodal adjuvant therapy, only subclinical cardiac changes were observed in both 3DCRT patients with inclusion of small to moderate amounts of heart volume in RT tangents and in the patients treated with IMRT and reduced high-dose heart exposure. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed through April 2015. A multidisciplinary expert workgroup with expertise in primary care, gynecology, surgical oncology,medical oncology, radiation oncology, and nursing was formed and tasked with drafting the Breast Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline. A total of 1,073 articles met inclusion criteria; and, after full text review, 237were included as the evidence base. Patients should undergo regular surveillance for breast cancer recurrence, including evaluation with a cancer-related history and physical examination, and should be screened for new primary breast cancer. Data do not support performing routine laboratory tests or imaging tests in asymptomatic patients to evaluate for breast cancer recurrence. Primary care clinicians should counsel patients about the importance ofmaintaining a healthy lifestyle, monitor for posttreatment symptoms that can adversely affect quality of life, and monitor for adherence to endocrine therapy. Recommendations provided in this guideline are based on current evidence in the literature and expert consensus opinion. Most of the evidence is not sufficient to warrant a strong evidence-based recommendation. Recommendations on surveillance for breast cancer recurrence, screening for second primary cancers, assessment and management of physical and psychosocial long-term and late effects of breast cancer and its treatment, health promotion, and care coordination/practice implications are made. This guideline was developed through a collaboration between the American Cancer Society and the American Society of Clinical Oncology and has been published jointly by invitation and consent in both CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians and Journal of Clinical Oncology.

Patients with stage II or III breast cancer, including inflammatory disease, with HER2 overexpression (immunohistochemistry and/or fluorescent in situ hybridization) were treated with 24 weekly administrations of paclitaxel 70 mg/m2, carboplatin AUC = 3 mg/mL/minute, and trastuzumab 2 mg/kg (loading dose 4 mg/kg). In cycles 7, 8, 15, 16, 23, and 24, only trastuzumab was given. The primary end point was pathologic complete response (pCR) in both breast and axilla. Of 61 evaluable patients, 61% had stage II disease and 75% were node-positive. The median NRI (Neoadjuvant Response Index, a measure of the degree of downstaging by chemotherapy) of all patients was 0.86. Twenty-seven (44%) had a NRI of 1.0, which corresponds to pCR in breast and lymph nodes. The most commonly reported grade 3/4 toxicities were neutropenia (72%) and thrombocytopenia (36%). Dose reduction was necessary in 51% of the patients. A weekly carboplatin-paclitaxel-trastuzumab neo-adjuvant regimen is highly active in HER2-positive breast cancer with an acceptable toxicity profile.

Jebsen Cardiac Research Centre, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway","Aims Contemporary adjuvant treatment for early breast cancer is associated with improved survival but at the cost of increased risk of cardiotoxicity and cardiac dysfunction. We tested the hypothesis that concomitant therapy with the angiotensin receptor blocker candesartan or the β-blocker metoprolol will alleviate the decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) associated with adjuvant, anthracycline-containing regimens with or without trastuzumab and radiation. Methods and results In a 2 × 2 factorial, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, we assigned 130 adult women with early breast cancer and no serious co-morbidity to the angiotensin receptor blocker candesartan cilexetil, the β-blocker metoprolol succinate, or matching placebos in parallel with adjuvant anticancer therapy. The primary outcome measure was change in LVEF by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. A priori, a change of 5 percentage points was considered clinically important. There was no interaction between candesartan and metoprolol treatments (P = 0.530). The overall decline in LVEF was 2.6 (95% CI 1.5, 3.8) percentage points in the placebo group and 0.8 (95% CI -0.4, 1.9) in the candesartan group in the intention-to-treat analysis (P-value for between-group difference: 0.026). No effect of metoprolol on the overall decline in LVEF was observed. Conclusion In patients treated for early breast cancer with adjuvant anthracycline-containing regimens with or without trastuzumab and radiation, concomitant treatment with candesartan provides protection against early decline in global left ventricular function. © 2016 The Author 2016.","Angiotensin antagonist; b-Blocker; Biomarkers; Breast cancer; Cardiomyopathy; Imaging","Adrenergic beta-Antagonists; Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Anthracyclines; Antineoplastic Agents; Benzimidazoles; Biphenyl Compounds; Breast Neoplasms; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Double-Blind Method; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Heart Failure; Humans; Metoprolol; Middle Aged; Tetrazoles; Trastuzumab; Treatment Outcome; anthracycline; candesartan hexetil; cyclophosphamide; epirubicin; fluorouracil; metoprolol succinate; placebo; trastuzumab; angiotensin receptor antagonist; anthracycline; antineoplastic agent; benzimidazole derivative; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; biphenyl derivative; candesartan hexetil; metoprolol; tetrazole derivative; trastuzumab; adjuvant therapy; adult; Article; breast cancer; cancer adjuvant therapy; cardiac dysfunction; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; controlled study; double blind procedure; female; heart disease; human; intention to treat analysis; major clinical study; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; unspecified side effect; adjuvant chemotherapy; breast tumor; combination drug therapy; heart failure; treatment outcome","T.

IBs used daily in oncology include clinical TNM stage, objective response and left ventricular ejection fraction. Other CT, MRI, PET and ultrasonography biomarkers are used extensively in cancer research and drug development. New IBs need to be established either as useful tools for testing research hypotheses in clinical trials and research studies, or as clinical decision-making tools for use in healthcare, by crossing 'translational gaps' through validation and qualification. Important differences exist between IBs and biospecimen-derived biomarkers and, therefore, the development of IBs requires a tailored 'roadmap'. Recognizing this need, Cancer Research UK (CRUK) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) assembled experts to review, debate and summarize the challenges of IB validation and qualification. This consensus group has produced 14 key recommendations for accelerating the clinical translation of IBs, which highlight the role of parallel (rather than sequential) tracks of technical (assay) validation, biological/clinical validation and assessment of cost-effectiveness; the need for IB standardization and accreditation systems; the need to continually revisit IB precision; an alternative framework for biological/clinical validation of IBs; and the essential requirements for multicentre studies to qualify IBs for clinical use. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging with myocardial strain studies has been used to evaluate subclinical biventricular myocardial changes, however, its clinical utility during chemotherapy has not been evaluated. Methods: The clinical outcomes, CMR and cardiac biomarkers of 9 women aged 62.3 ± 12.6 years with early or locally advanced breast cancer were evaluated at baseline, and at 3, 6 and 12 months after the initiation of trastuzumab. Results: None of the patients developed heart failure or elevated serum cardiac biomarkers. Global left ventricular (LV) peak systolic longitudinal and circumferential strains were significantly decreased at 6 months (longitudinal strains, -21.1 ± 1.7% [baseline] vs. -19.5 ± 1.0% [6 months], p = 0.039, and circumferential strains, -23.4 ± 1.8% [baseline] vs. -21.6 ± 2.5% [6 months], p = 0.036). These changes were analogous to those observed in the LV ejection fraction. Right ventricular (RV) free wall peak systolic circumferential strains were decreased at 6 months (-20.9% ± 2.4% [baseline] vs. -19.1% ± 2.3% [6 months], p = 0.049), whereas RV longitudinal strains and ejection fraction remained unchanged. The LV longitudinal strain was the most reproducible of the 4 peak strain parameters. Conclusions: The LV longitudinal and circumferential strains measured by CMR decreased during trastuzumab therapy, although their predictive value for later heart failure or association with RV parameters was not determined. These techniques may be a useful means of diagnosing and monitoring trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity. © 2016 Via Medica.","Breast cancer; Cardiac magnetic resonance; Cardiotoxicity; Myocardial strain; Trastuzumab","Antineoplastic Agents; Breast Neoplasms; Cardiotoxicity; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Middle Aged; Myocardium; Pilot Projects; Retrospective Studies; Stroke Volume; Trastuzumab; Ventricular Function, Left; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; brain natriuretic peptide; carboplatin; cyclophosphamide; docetaxel; epirubicin; myosin light chain; trastuzumab; troponin I; antineoplastic agent; trastuzumab; adult; Article; breast cancer; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; cardiovascular parameters; clinical article; echocardiography; feasibility study; female; heart failure; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; human; loading drug dose; myocardial strain; pilot study; predictive value; treatment outcome; Breast Neoplasms; cardiac muscle; cardiotoxicity; cine magnetic resonance imaging; drug effects; heart left ventricle function; heart stroke volume; middle aged; pathology; procedures; retrospective study","S.

Unfortunately, the use of anthracyclines is limited by their dose-dependent and cumulative cardiotoxicity. The molecular mechanism responsible for anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity remains poorly understood, although experimental and clinical studies have shown that oxidative stress plays the main role. Hence, antioxidant agents, especially dexrazoxane, and also other drug classes (statins, β-blockers) proved to have a beneficial effect in protecting against anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. According to previous clinical trials, the major highrisk factors for anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity are age, body weight, female gender, radiotherapy, and other diseases such as Down syndrome, familial dilated cardiomyopathy, diabetes and hypertension. Consequently, further studies are needed to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity and also to discover new cardioprotective agents against anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. © 2016 Termedia & Banach.","Anthracycline; Breast cancer; Cardiotoxicity; Doxorubicin","anthracycline; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; biological marker; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; dobutamine; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; radioisotope; ranolazine; razoxane; Article; breast cancer; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; congestive cardiomyopathy; Down syndrome; echocardiography; genetic variability; human; hypertension; kwashiorkor; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; radioisotope ventriculography; risk factor; stress echocardiography","F.

Breast cancer and lymphoma survivors in up to 26% of cases can develop complications as a consequence of the chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic treatments. Echocardiography is a noninvasive method that can in all stages of cancer treatment perform a comprehensive evaluation and detect coronary, myocardial, valve and pericardial disease complications secondary to the therapeutic regimen used (radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy). Three-dimensional echocardiography derived left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) has an excellent correlation with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and can be used to monitor LVEF; 2-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (2D-STE) derived strain and strain rate can detect changes in myocardial mechanics before changes in LVEF occur and can predict a future decrease in ejection fraction to less than 50% or of greater than 10% indicative of cardiotoxicity. Echocardiography should be used as the method of choice to evaluate serial changes in heart function, detect late side effects of treatment, and to identify patients at risk of a future decrease in LVEF. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Breast cancer; Cardio-oncology; Lymphoma; Radiotherapy; Strain","Animals; Cardiology; Echocardiography; Heart Neoplasms; Humans; Medical Oncology; Neoplasms; Breast cancer; Cardio-oncology; Lymphoma; Radiotherapy; Strain; anthracycline derivative; article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer radiotherapy; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular risk; computer assisted tomography; contrast echocardiography; coronary artery disease; diastolic dysfunction; disease course; disease severity; early diagnosis; echocardiography; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle failure; hematologic malignancy; histopathology; human; left ventricular systolic dysfunction; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; pericardial disease; solid tumor; systolic dysfunction; tissue Doppler imaging; two dimensional echocardiography; two dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography; valvular heart disease","H.R.

Methods and Results - We performed blinded cardiovascular magnetic resonance analyses of left ventricular T1 and extracellular volume (ECV) fraction in 327 individuals (65% women, aged 64±12 years). Thirty-seven individuals had breast cancer or a hematologic malignancy but had not yet initiated their treatment, and 54 cancer survivors who received either anthracycline-based (n=37) or nonanthracycline-based (n=17) chemotherapy 2.8±1.3 years earlier were compared with 236 cancer-free participants. Multivariable analyses were performed to determine the association between T1/ECV measures and variables associated with myocardial fibrosis. Age-adjusted native T1 was elevated pre- (1058±7 ms) and post- (1040±7 ms) receipt of anthracycline chemotherapy versus comparators (965±3 ms; P<0.0001 for both). Age-adjusted ECV, a marker of myocardial fibrosis, was elevated in anthracycline-treated cancer participants (30.4±0.7%) compared with either pretreatment cancer (27.8±0.7%; P<0.01) or cancer-free comparators (26.9±0.2%; P<0.0001). T1 and ECV of nonanthracycline survivors were no different than pretreatment survivors (P=0.17 and P=0.16, respectively). Native T1 and ECV remained elevated in cancer survivors after accounting for demographics (including age), myocardial fibrosis risk factors, and left ventricular ejection fraction or myocardial mass index (P<0.0001 for all). Conclusions - Three years after anthracycline-based chemotherapy, elevations in myocardial T1 and ECV occur independent of underlying cancer or cardiovascular comorbidities, suggesting that imaging biomarkers of interstitial fibrosis in cancer survivors are related to prior receipt of a potentially cardiotoxic cancer treatment regimen. © 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.","cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging; extracellular volume; myocardial fibrosis; T1 mapping","Aged; Anthracyclines; Antineoplastic Agents; Cardiomyopathies; Cardiotoxicity; Comorbidity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Edema, Cardiac; Female; Fibrosis; Humans; Least-Squares Analysis; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Myocardium; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Risk Factors; Stroke Volume; Survivors; Time Factors; United States; Ventricular Function, Left; anthracycline; doxorubicin; gadolinium pentetate meglumine; gadoteridol; anthracycline; antineoplastic agent; adult; age; aged; Article; Black person; breast cancer; cancer chemotherapy; cancer survivor; cardiotoxicity; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; cardiovascular parameters; cardiovascular risk; Caucasian; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; coronary artery disease; diabetes mellitus; disease association; drug dose reduction; exploratory research; extracellular space; female; heart edema; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle muscle; heart muscle fibrosis; hematologic malignancy; Hispanic; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; leukemia; lymphoma; major clinical study; male; middle aged; myocardial mass index; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; priority journal; sarcoma; sex; weight, mass and size; cardiac muscle; Cardiomyopathies; cardiotoxicity; chemically induced; cine magnetic resonance imaging; comorbidity; cross-sectional study; diagnostic imaging; Edema, Cardiac; fibrosis; heart left ventricle function; heart stroke volume; least square analysis; multivariate analysis; pathology; predictive value; prognosis; risk factor; survivor; time factor; United States","W.G.
