"8656,pub.1143460380,10.1536/ihj.21-388,34853231,,Detection of Profound Myocardial Damage by Cardiac MRI in a Patient with Severe Cardiotoxicity Induced by Anti-HER2 Therapy,""Anti-HER2 therapy has greatly improved the long-term prognosis of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. Meanwhile, by interfering with the protective effects of neuregulin-1/HER2 signaling on stressed cardiomyocytes, anti-HER2 therapy occasionally induces reversible cancer therapeutics-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD). Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) parametric mapping or myocardial feature-tracking, in combination with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging, has the potential to detect changes in the myocardium in anti-HER2 therapy-related cardiac dysfunction. Here we report a breast cancer patient who experienced life-threatening CTRCD after treatment with trastuzumab plus pertuzumab. This case showed multiple transmural LGE-positive myocardial lesions in CMR imaging and high native T1 and T2 values in CMR parametric mapping, which was apparently more extensive than those observed in most patients with anti-HER2 therapy-related cardiac dysfunction. Consistent with profound myocardial damage indicated by CMR, her cardiac function was not fully restored despite intensive care and cardioprotective drug therapy. These findings suggest the potential usefulness of LGE imaging and parametric mapping by CMR for the assessment of myocardial injury to determine the clinical severity of anti-HER2 therapy-related cardiac dysfunction."",,,International Heart Journal,,,""Adult"; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological; Breast Neoplasms; Cardiac Output, Low; Female; Heart; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Shock, Cardiogenic; Stroke Volume; Trastuzumab;" Ventricular Dysfunction, Left"",2021-11-29,2021,,2021-11-29,62,6,1436-1441,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Kadowaki, Hiroshi"; Ishida, Junichi; Uehara, Masae; Ishizuka, Masato; Kiyosue, Arihiro; Hatano, Masaru; Shimada, Shogo; Ono, Minoru; Akazawa, Hiroshi;" Komuro, Issei"",""Kadowaki, Hiroshi (Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, The University of Tokyo.)"; Ishida, Junichi (Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, The University of Tokyo.); Uehara, Masae (Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, The University of Tokyo.); Ishizuka, Masato (Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, The University of Tokyo.); Kiyosue, Arihiro (Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, The University of Tokyo.); Hatano, Masaru (Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, The University of Tokyo.); Shimada, Shogo (Department of Cardiac Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo.); Ono, Minoru (Department of Cardiac Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo.); Akazawa, Hiroshi (Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, The University of Tokyo.);" Komuro, Issei (Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, The University of Tokyo.)"",,""Kadowaki, Hiroshi (University of Tokyo)"; Ishida, Junichi (University of Tokyo); Uehara, Masae (University of Tokyo); Ishizuka, Masato (University of Tokyo); Kiyosue, Arihiro (University of Tokyo); Hatano, Masaru (University of Tokyo); Shimada, Shogo (University of Tokyo); Ono, Minoru (University of Tokyo); Akazawa, Hiroshi (University of Tokyo);" Komuro, Issei (University of Tokyo)"",2,2,,0.83,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ihj/62/6/62_21-388/_pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143460380,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences"; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Although chemotherapy significantly increases survival, the risk of cardiovascular disease development is high and still underestimated and could imply treatment discontinuation. Frequently, due to lack of rigorous diagnosis strategies, cardiotoxicity assessment is delayed, and, moreover, the efficacy of current therapy options in restoring heart function is questionable. For a comprehensive risk assessment, it is vital to characterize the clinical spectrum of HER2-targeted agents and anthracyclines, as well as their pathogenic pathways involved in cardiotoxicity. Advanced cardiovascular multimodal imaging and circulating biomarkers plays primary roles in early assessing cardiotoxicity and also in guiding specific preventive measures. Even though the knowledge in this field is rapidly expanding, there are still questions that arise regarding the optimal approach in terms of timing and methods.

Cardiac MRI was performed before treatment and three months after starting, covering ventricular volumes, cardiac function, systolic myocardial strain, myocardial oedema, and T1 and T2 relaxation times. Cardiac dysfunction was primarily defined as a > 10% reduction in LV ejection fraction (LVEF) to < 55% and/or a > 15% global longitudinal strain (GLS) change at the follow-up MRI examination.ResultsTwenty-four HER2-positive patients were evaluated (16 in the dual anti-HER2 group, 8 in the trastuzumab group). Six patients developed cardiac dysfunction at follow-up, five of them in the dual anti-HER2 group. One patient developed symptomatic heart failure, and five patients developed asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction. Patients displayed significantly decreased systolic function and increased T1 and T2 relaxation time at follow-up (p ≤ 0.031). Systolic dysfunction remained significant in the dual anti-HER2 group. The decrease in GLS in the trastuzumab group was not significant (p = 0.169). T1 and T2 relaxation times tended to increase, but this was not significant at subgroup analysis.ConclusionsCardiac MRI scans showed frequent signs of subclinical cardiotoxicity after short-term anti-HER2 therapy and nonanthracycline-based chemotherapy";" the effect was slightly stronger in patients treated with dual therapy.Key points• A frequent subclinical cardiotoxicity was detected by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging after short-term anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) therapy.• The change in myocardial strain was more marked in patients treated with dual (trastuzumab plus pertuzumab) than with trastuzumab only anti-HER2 therapy.• Cardiotoxicity surveillance through MRI is an interesting option particularly in patients treated with dual anti-HER2 therapy."",,""This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81971616), the Medical and Health Science and Technology Innovation Project of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (2021-I2M-C&T-B-065), and the Beijing Hope Run Special Fund of Cancer Foundation of China (LC2020B19)."",European Radiology Experimental,,,""Female"; Humans; Breast Neoplasms; Cardiotoxicity; Heart Diseases; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Trastuzumab;" Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized"",2023-05-15,2023,2023-05-15,,7,1,22,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Cheng, Sainan"; Wang, Jianwei; Wang, Yawen; Qi, Linlin; Li, Fenglan; Liu, Jianing; Chen, Jiaqi; Fan, Yang;" Xie, Lizhi"",""Cheng, Sainan (Department of Diagnostic Radiology, National Cancer Center / Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, #17 Panjiayuan Nanli, Chaoyang District, 100021, Beijing, China)"; Wang, Jianwei (Department of Diagnostic Radiology, National Cancer Center / Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, #17 Panjiayuan Nanli, Chaoyang District, 100021, Beijing, China); Wang, Yawen (Department of Diagnostic Radiology, National Cancer Center / Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, #17 Panjiayuan Nanli, Chaoyang District, 100021, Beijing, China); Qi, Linlin (Department of Diagnostic Radiology, National Cancer Center / Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, #17 Panjiayuan Nanli, Chaoyang District, 100021, Beijing, China); Li, Fenglan (Department of Diagnostic Radiology, National Cancer Center / Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, #17 Panjiayuan Nanli, Chaoyang District, 100021, Beijing, China); Liu, Jianing (Department of Diagnostic Radiology, National Cancer Center / Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, #17 Panjiayuan Nanli, Chaoyang District, 100021, Beijing, China); Chen, Jiaqi (Department of Diagnostic Radiology, National Cancer Center / Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, #17 Panjiayuan Nanli, Chaoyang District, 100021, Beijing, China); Fan, Yang (MR Research China, GE Healthcare, Beijing, China);" Xie, Lizhi (MR Research China, GE Healthcare, Beijing, China)"",""Wang, Jianwei (Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College)"",""Cheng, Sainan (Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College)"; Wang, Jianwei (Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College); Wang, Yawen (Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College); Qi, Linlin (Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College); Li, Fenglan (Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College); Liu, Jianing (Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College); Chen, Jiaqi (Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College); Fan, Yang (MR Research China, GE Healthcare, Beijing, China);" Xie, Lizhi (MR Research China, GE Healthcare, Beijing, China)"",1,1,,,https://eurradiolexp.springeropen.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s41747-023-00338-9,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158036129,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences"; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

RESULTS: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging emerged as the most definitive modality, offering real-time detection, comprehensive assessment of cardiac function, the ability to detect early myocardial changes, and superior detection of cardiotoxicity when compared to the other imaging modalities.

CONCLUSION: Due to the common use of HER2 agents and anthracyclines within the breast cancer population, the LVEF as a critical prognostic measurement for assessing heart health and estimating the severity of left-sided cardiac malfunction is a commonly used endpoint. CTRCD rates differed between imaging modalities, with cardiac MRI the most sensitive. The use of multimodal cardiac imaging remains a nuanced area, influenced by local availability, the clinical question at hand, body habits, and medical comorbidities. All of the imaging modalities listed have a role to play in current care;" however, focus should be given to increasing the provision of cardiac MRI for breast cancer patients in the future to optimize the detection of CTRCD and patient outcomes thereafter."",No grants or awards require declaration.,This research received no external funding.,Journal of Clinical Medicine,,,,2023-09-29,2023,2023-09-29,,12,19,6295,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Cronin, Michael"; Seher, Mehreen; Arsang-Jang, Shahram; Lowery, Aoife; Kerin, Michael; Wijns, William;" Soliman, Osama"",""Cronin, Michael (CORRIB Core Laboratory, University of Galway, H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland, m.--2@nuigalway.ie, (M.S.)";); Seher, Mehreen (CORRIB Core Laboratory, University of Galway, H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland, m.--2@nuigalway.ie, (M.S.);); Arsang-Jang, Shahram (CORRIB Core Laboratory, University of Galway, H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland, m.--2@nuigalway.ie, (M.S.);); Lowery, Aoife (Precision Cardio-Oncology Research Enterprise (P-CORE), H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland; CURAM Centre for Medical Devices, H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland); Kerin, Michael (Precision Cardio-Oncology Research Enterprise (P-CORE), H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland; Discipline of Surgery, Lambe Institute for Translational Research, University of Galway, H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland); Wijns, William (CORRIB Core Laboratory, University of Galway, H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland, m.--2@nuigalway.ie, (M.S.);; Precision Cardio-Oncology Research Enterprise (P-CORE), H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland; CURAM Centre for Medical Devices, H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland); Soliman, Osama (CORRIB Core Laboratory, University of Galway, H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland, m.--2@nuigalway.ie, (M.S.);; Precision Cardio-Oncology Research Enterprise (P-CORE), H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland; CURAM Centre for Medical Devices, H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland;" Discipline of Cardiology, Saolta Group, Galway University Hospital, Health Service Executive and CORRIB Core Laboratory, National University of Ireland Galway (NUIG), H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland)"",""Soliman, Osama (University of Galway"; Precision Cardio-Oncology Research Enterprise (P-CORE), H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland; CURAM Centre for Medical Devices, H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland; University Hospital Galway;" University of Galway)"",""Cronin, Michael (University of Galway)"; Seher, Mehreen (University of Galway); Arsang-Jang, Shahram (University of Galway); Lowery, Aoife (Precision Cardio-Oncology Research Enterprise (P-CORE), H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland; CURAM Centre for Medical Devices, H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland); Kerin, Michael (Precision Cardio-Oncology Research Enterprise (P-CORE), H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland; University of Galway); Wijns, William (University of Galway; Precision Cardio-Oncology Research Enterprise (P-CORE), H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland; CURAM Centre for Medical Devices, H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland); Soliman, Osama (University of Galway; Precision Cardio-Oncology Research Enterprise (P-CORE), H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland; CURAM Centre for Medical Devices, H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland; University Hospital Galway;" University of Galway)"",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/19/6295/pdf?version=1695993299,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164561220,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences"; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Based on the observed values, we aimed to evaluate the cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines in cancer patients and to analyze the consistency of the two examination methods in assessing left ventricular function after chemotherapy.MethodsFrom January 2020 to January 2022, the data of 80 patients with malignant tumors who received anthracycline chemotherapy (breast cancer, n = 40";" gastric cancer, n = 40) and 40 healthy volunteers (Control group) were retrospectively collected. Serum high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) levels were detected by an automatic immunoassay analyzer. Left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were measured by cardiac MRI and 2-dimensional ECHO using the biplane Simpson’s method.ResultsCompared with baseline values, serum high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) levels were significantly increased in patients with breast cancer and gastric cancer after 6 cycles of chemotherapy (P < 0.05). In addition, LVEDV, LVESV and LVEF measured with MRI were higher than those detected by ECHO in cancer patients after 6 cycles of chemotherapy (P < 0.05). And the Bland-Altman plot analysis showed that LVEDV, LVESV and LVEF measured by the two examination methods were in good agreement.ConclusionBreast and gastric cancer patients exhibited elevated levels of hs-cTnT after 6 cycles of chemotherapy, indicating potential cardiotoxicity.

In recent years, there have been growing interests regarding the application of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, a safe and noninvasive modality, with the potential to identify subtle morphological and functional changes in the myocardium. In this investigation, we aimed to review the performance of various CMR methods in diagnosing cardiotoxicity in BC, induced by chemotherapy or radiotherapy. For this purpose, we reviewed the literature available in PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases. Our literature review showed that CMR is a valuable modality for identifying and predicting subclinical cardiotoxicity induced by chemotherapy. The novel T1, T2, and extracellular volume mapping techniques may provide critical information about cardiotoxicity, in addition to other CMR features such as functional and structural changes. However, further research is needed to verify the exact role of these methods in identifying cardiotoxicity and patient management.

We aim to investigate the use of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate early tissue changes and perform functional assessment of chemo- and radiation-induced cardiotoxicity and to identify MRI prognostic indicators of cardiotoxicity in breast cancer patients.MethodsA 3-min cardiac imaging protocol will be added to the breast MRI examination to diagnose cardiotoxicity in breast cancer patients. Standardized MRI-based evaluation of breast cancer and the left ventricular myocardium will be performed at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months and 2 years or more after cancer treatment. We will analyze both ventricular volume and ejection fraction (EF), strain of left ventricle (LV), native T1, extracellular volume fraction (ECV), and T2 values acquired in the mid LV.DiscussionThe primary result of this study will be the comparison of the prognostic value of MRI parameters (native T1, ECV, both ventricular systolic function and LV strain) for cardiotoxicity. The endpoint is defined as the occurrence of a major adverse cardiac event (MACE). The secondary outcome will be an assessment of the temporal relationships between contractile dysfunction and microstructural injury over 4 years using MRI.

Serial CMRs were performed at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months after initiation of trastuzumab. LA volumes were measured by a blinded reader. Linear mixed model was used to evaluate longitudinal changes.ResultsOf 41 women (mean age 52 ± 11 [SD] years";" 56% received anthracycline), one patient experienced trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity (TIC) for which trastuzumab was interrupted for one cycle. Mean baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 68.0 ± 5.9% and LA ejection fraction (LAEF) was 66.0 ± 6.6%. Compared to baseline, LAEF decreased significantly at 6 months (62.7 ± 5.7%, p = 0.027) and 12 months (62.2 ± 6.1%, p = 0.003), while indexed LA minimum volume (LAmin) significantly increased at 12 months (11.6 ± 4.9 ml/m2 vs 13.8 ± 4.5 ml/m2, p = 0.002). At 18 months, all changes from baseline were no longer significant. From baseline to 6 months, change in LAEF correlated with change in LVEF (Spearman’s r = 0.41, p = 0.014). No significant interactions (all p > 0.10) were detected between time and anthracycline use for LA parameters.ConclusionsAmong trastuzumab-treated patients with low incidence of TIC, we observed a small but significant decline in LAEF and increase in LAmin that persisted for the duration of therapy and recovered 6 months after therapy cessation. These findings suggest that trastuzumab has concurrent detrimental effects on atrial and ventricular remodeling.Key Points• In trastuzumab-treated breast cancer patients evaluated by cardiac MRI, left atrial ejection fraction declined and minimum volume increased during treatment and recovered to baseline after trastuzumab cessation.• Changes in left atrial ejection fraction correlated with changes in left ventricular ejection fraction in the first 6 months of trastuzumab treatment.• Trastuzumab therapy is associated with concurrent detrimental effects on left atrial and ventricular remodeling."",We are indebted to all the study participants and coordinators in this study.,""This study was supported by an operating grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and an industry partnered grant from Roche Canada.

Recent advances in systemic and local treatments have significantly improved survival rates of patients having early breast cancer. In the last decade, great attention has been paid to the prevention and early detection of cardiotoxicity induced by breast cancer treatments. Systemic therapy-related cardiac toxicities have been extensively studied. Radiotherapy, an essential component of breast cancer treatment, can also increase the risk of heart diseases. Consequently, it is important to balance the expected benefits of cancer treatment with cardiovascular risk and to identify strategies to prevent cardiotoxicity and improve long-term outcomes and quality of life for these patients.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
OBJECTIVE: This CardioTox Breast study aims to investigate the use of cardiac imaging, based on cardiac magnetic resonance and echocardiography, and to identify associated circulating biomarkers to assess early tissue changes in chemo-induced and radiation-induced cardiotoxicity in the time window of 12 months after the end of radiotherapy in patients with breast cancer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
METHODS: The CardioTox Breast trial is a multicenter observational prospective longitudinal study. We aim to enroll 150 women with stage I-III unilateral breast cancer, treated with breast conserving surgery, who planned to receive radiotherapy with or without systemic therapy. Baseline and follow-up data include cardiac measurements based on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiography, and circulating biomarkers of cardiac toxicity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RESULTS: This study details the protocol of the CardioTox Breast trial. Recruitment started in September 2020. The results of this study will not be published until data are mature for the final analysis of the primary study end point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CONCLUSIONS: The CardioTox Breast study is designed to investigate the effects of systemic and radiation therapy on myocardial function and structure, thus providing additional evidence on whether cardiac magnetic resonance is the optimal screening imaging for cardiotoxicity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

OBJECTIVES: To assess CMR circumferential and global longitudinal strain (GLS) correlations with cardiovascular outcomes including myocardial infarction, systolic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction, arrhythmias and valvular disease in breast cancer patients treated with and without anthracyclines and/or trastuzumab therapy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
METHODS: Breast cancer patients with a CMR from 2013-2017 at Yale New Haven Hospital were included. Patient co-morbidities, medications, and cardiovascular outcomes were obtained from chart review. Biostatistical analyses, including Pearson correlations, competing risk regression model, and competing risk survival curves comparing the two groups were analyzed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RESULTS: 116 breast cancer with CMRs were included in our analysis to assess differences between Anthracycline/Trastuzumab (AT) (62) treated versus non anthracycline/trastuzumab (NAT) (54) treated patients in terms of imaging characteristics and outcomes. More AT patients 17 (27.4%) developed systolic heart failure compared to the NAT group 6 (10.9%), p = 0.025. Statin use was associated with a significant reduction in future arrhythmias (HR 0.416; 95% CI 0.229-0.755, p = 0.004). In a sub-group of 13 patients that underwent stress CMR, we did not find evidence of microvascular dysfunction by sub-endocardial/sub-epicardial myocardial perfusion index ratio after adjusting for ischemic heart disease.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Methods: This retrospective study included the patients with HER2+ early-stage breast cancer who received NACT with the regimen TCbHP or AC-THP and then underwent surgery from 2019 to 2022. pCR rate and breast-conserving rate were calculated to evaluate the efficacy of the regimens. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from echocardiograms and abnormal electrocardiographs (ECGs) were collected to evaluate the cardiotoxicity of the two regimens. Association between the characteristics of the breast cancer lesions by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the pCR rate were also explored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Results: A total of 159 patients were enrolled, including 48 patients in the AC-THP group and 111 patients in the TCbHP group. The pCR rate of the TCbHP group 64.0% (71/111) was significantly higher than that of for the the AC-THP group 37.5% (18/48) (P=0.002). Estrogen receptor (ER) status (P=0.011, OR: 0.437, 95% CI: 0.231-0.829), progesterone receptor (PR) status (P=0.001, OR: 0.309, 95% CI: 0.157-0.608) and IHC HER2 status (P=0.003, OR: 7.167, 95% CI: 1.970-26.076) were significantly correlated with the pCR rate. LVEF decreased at 6 and 12 months after treatment in the AC-THP group (P=0.024 and 0.040), which only decreased after 6 months of treatment in the TCbHP group (P=0.048). Post-NACT MRI characteristics including mass features (P<0.001) and enhancement type (P<0.001) were significantly associated with pCR rate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Conclusions: Early-stage HER2+ breast cancer treated with the TCbHP regimen has a higher pCR rate than the AC-THP group. The TCbHP regimen appears to have lower cardiotoxicity than the AC-THP regimen in terms of LVEF.

Objective: To describe changes in CMR tissue biomarkers during breast cancer therapy and their association with CTRCD.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a prospective, multicenter, cohort study of women with ERBB2 (formerly HER2)-positive breast cancer (stages I-III) who were scheduled to receive anthracycline and trastuzumab therapy with/without adjuvant radiotherapy and surgery. From November 7, 2013, to January 16, 2019, participants were recruited from 3 University of Toronto-affiliated hospitals. Data were analyzed from July 2021 to June 2022.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Exposures: Sequential therapy with anthracyclines, trastuzumab, and radiation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Main Outcomes and Measures: CMR, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI), and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) measurements were performed before anthracycline treatment, after anthracycline and before trastuzumab treatment, and at 3-month intervals during trastuzumab therapy. CMR included left ventricular (LV) volumes, LV ejection fraction (EF), myocardial strain, early gadolinium enhancement imaging to assess hyperemia (inflammation marker), native/postcontrast T1 mapping (with extracellular volume fraction [ECV]) to assess edema and/or fibrosis, T2 mapping to assess edema, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) to assess replacement fibrosis. CTRCD was defined using the Cardiac Review and Evaluation Committee criteria. Fixed-effects models or generalized estimating equations were used in analyses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Results: Of 136 women (mean [SD] age, 51.1 [9.2] years) recruited from 2013 to 2019, 37 (27%) developed CTRCD. Compared with baseline, tissue biomarkers of myocardial hyperemia and edema peaked after anthracycline therapy or 3 months after trastuzumab initiation as demonstrated by an increase in mean (SD) relative myocardial enhancement (baseline, 46.3% [16.8%] to peak, 56.2% [18.6%]), native T1 (1012 [26] milliseconds to 1035 [28] milliseconds), T2 (51.4 [2.2] milliseconds to 52.6 [2.2] milliseconds), and ECV (25.2% [2.4%] to 26.8% [2.7%]), with P <.001 for the entire follow-up. The observed values were mostly within the normal range, and the changes were small and recovered during follow-up. No new replacement fibrosis developed. Increase in T1, T2, and/or ECV was associated with increased ventricular volumes and BNP but not hs-cTnI level. None of the CMR tissue biomarkers were associated with changes in LVEF or myocardial strain. Change in ECV was associated with concurrent and subsequent CTRCD, but there was significant overlap between patients with and without CTRCD.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Conclusions and Relevance: In women with ERBB2-positive breast cancer receiving sequential anthracycline and trastuzumab therapy, CMR tissue biomarkers suggest inflammation and edema peaking early during therapy and were associated with ventricular remodeling and BNP elevation. However, the increases in CMR biomarkers were transient, were not associated with LVEF or myocardial strain, and were not useful in identifying traditional CTRCD risk."",,""Funding/Support: This study was funded by operating grants 137132, 142456, and 147814 from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Ontario Early Research Award, the Grant Miller Research grant from the University of Toronto, and the Canadian Cancer Society/Canadian Institutes of Health Research’s W.

We report results from a prospective clinical trial evaluating early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and serum biomarker changes as predictors of cardiac injury and risk of subsequent cardiac events after RT for left-sided disease.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
METHODS: Women with node-negative and node-positive (N-/+) left-sided BC were enrolled on 2 institutional review board (IRB)-approved protocols at 2 institutions. MRI was conducted pretreatment (within 1 week of starting radiation), at the end of treatment (last day of treatment ±1 week), and 3 months after the last day of treatment (±2 weeks) to quantify left and right ventricular volumes and function, myocardial fibrosis, and edema. Perfusion changes during regadenoson stress perfusion were also assessed on a subset of patients (n = 28). Serum was collected at the same time points. Whole heart and cardiac substructures were contoured using CT and MRI. Models were constructed using baseline cardiac and clinical risk factors. Associations between MRI-measured changes and dose were evaluated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RESULTS: Among 51 women enrolled, mean heart dose ranged from 0.80 to 4.7 Gy and mean left ventricular (LV) dose from 1.1 to 8.2 Gy, with mean heart dose 2.0 Gy. T1 time, a marker of fibrosis, and right ventricular (RV) ejection fraction (EF) significantly changed with treatment; these were not dose dependent. T2 (marker of edema) and LV EF did not significantly change. No risk factors were associated with baseline global perfusion. Prior receipt of doxorubicin was marginally associated with decreased myocardial perfusion after RT (P = .059), and mean MHD was not associated with perfusion changes. A significant correlation between baseline IL-6 and mean heart dose (MHD) at the end of RT (ρ 0.44, P = .007) and a strong trend between troponin I and MHD at 3 months post-treatment (ρ 0.33, P = .07) were observed. No other significant correlations were identified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study of women with left-sided breast cancer treated with contemporary treatment planning, cardiac radiation doses were very low relative to historical doses reported by Darby et al. Although we observed significant changes in T1 and RV EF shortly after RT, these changes were not correlated with whole heart or substructure doses. Serum biomarker analysis of cardiac injury demonstrates an interesting trend between markers and MHD that warrants further investigation."",The authors would like to thank Steven Kronenberg for his assistance with graphic design and figure presentation.,,International Journal of Radiation Oncology • Biology • Physics,,,Biomarkers"; Breast Neoplasms; Cardiotoxicity; Female; Heart; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging;" Prospective Studies,2021-09-09,2021,2021-09-09,2022-02,112,2,417-425,Closed,Article,""Speers, Corey"; Murthy, Venkatesh L; Walker, Eleanor M; Glide-Hurst, Carri K; Marsh, Robin; Tang, Ming; Morris, Emily L; Schipper, Matthew J; Weinberg, Richard L; Gits, Hunter C; Hayman, James; Feng, Mary; Balter, James; Moran, Jean; Jagsi, Reshma;" Pierce, Lori J"",""Speers, Corey (Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan"; Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.); Murthy, Venkatesh L (Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan; Frankel Cardiovascular Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.); Walker, Eleanor M (Department of Radiation Oncology, Henry Ford Cancer Institute, Detroit, Michigan.); Glide-Hurst, Carri K (Department of Human Oncology, School of Medicine and Public Heath, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin.); Marsh, Robin (Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.); Tang, Ming (Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.); Morris, Emily L (Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.); Schipper, Matthew J (Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan; Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.); Weinberg, Richard L (Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan; Frankel Cardiovascular Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.); Gits, Hunter C (Department of Radiation Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.); Hayman, James (Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan; Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.); Feng, Mary (Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California.); Balter, James (Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.); Moran, Jean (Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.); Jagsi, Reshma (Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan; Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.); Pierce, Lori J (Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan;" Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.

METHODS AND RESULTS: This study was an analysis of serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and circulating biomarker data acquired from patients with HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer participating in a randomized-controlled clinical trial for the pharmaco-prevention of trastuzumab-associated cardiotoxicity. Circulating biomarkers (B-type natriuretic peptide, troponin I, MMP-2 and -9, GDF-15, neuregulin-1, and IGF-1) and MRI of cardiac structure and function and abdominal fat distribution were acquired prior to trastuzumab, post-cycle 4 and post-cycle 17. Ninety-four participants (51 ± 8 years) completed the study with 30 on placebo, 33 on perindopril, and 31 on bisoprolol. Post-cycle 4, global longitudinal strain deteriorated from baseline in both placebo (+2.0 ± 2.7%, P = 0.002) and perindopril (+0.9 ± 2.5%, P = 0.04), but not with bisoprolol (-0.2 ± 2.1%, P = 0.55). In all groups combined, extracellular volume fraction and GDF-15 increased post-cycle 4 (+1.3 ± 4.4%, P = 0.004; +130 ± 150%, P ≤ 0.001, respectively). However, no significant change in troponin I was detected throughout trastuzumab. In all groups combined, visceral and intermuscular fat volume increased post-cycle 4 (+7 ± 17%, P = 0.02, +8 ± 23%, P = 0.02, respectively), while muscle volume and IGF-1 decreased from post-cycle 4 to 17 (-2 ± 10%, P = 0.008, -18 ± 28%, P < 0.001, respectively).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity is highly variable in severity and without a proven therapeutic intervention. β-Adrenergic receptor blockers and renin-angiotensin-system inhibitor therapies have been associated with modest cardioprotective effects in unselected patients.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
METHODS: The Cardiac CARE trial is a multicentre prospective randomized open-label blinded end point trial of combination β-adrenergic receptor blocker and renin-angiotensin-system inhibitor therapy in patients with breast cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma receiving anthracycline chemotherapy that is associated with myocardial injury. Patients at higher risk of cardiotoxicity with plasma high-sensitivity cTnI (cardiac troponin I) concentrations in the upper tertile at the end of chemotherapy are randomized to standard of care plus combination candesartan and carvedilol therapy or standard of care alone. All patients undergo cardiac magnetic resonance imaging before and 6 months after anthracycline treatment. The primary end point is the change in left ventricular ejection fraction at 6 months after chemotherapy. In low-risk nonrandomized patients, left ventricular ejection fraction before and 6 months after anthracycline will be compared with define the specificity of the high-sensitivity cTnI assay for identifying low-risk participants who do not develop left ventricular systolic dysfunction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This study investigated an automated LV chamber quantification tool via segmentation with a supervised deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) before strain analysis with DENSE images. Segmentation for chamber quantification analysis was conducted with a custom DeepLabV3+ DCNN with ResNet-50 backbone on 42 female breast cancer datasets (22 training-sets, eight validation-sets and 12 independent test-sets). Parameters such as LV end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) and ejection fraction (LVEF) were quantified, and myocardial strains analyzed with the Radial Point Interpolation Method (RPIM). Myocardial classification was validated against ground-truth with sensitivity-specificity analysis, the metrics of Dice, average perpendicular distance (APD) and Hausdorff-distance. Following segmentation, validation was conducted with the Cronbach's Alpha (C-Alpha) intraclass correlation coefficient between LV chamber quantification results with DENSE and Steady State Free Precession (SSFP) acquisitions and a vendor tool-based method to segment the DENSE data, and similarly for myocardial strain analysis in the chambers. The results of myocardial classification from segmentation of the DENSE data were accuracy = 97%, Dice = 0.89 and APD = 2.4 mm in the test-set. The C-Alpha correlations from comparing chamber quantification results between the segmented DENSE and SSFP data and vendor tool-based method were 0.97 for LVEF (56 ± 7% vs 55 ± 7% vs 55 ± 6%, p = 0.6) and 0.77 for LVEDD (4.6 ± 0.4 cm vs 4.5 ± 0.3 cm vs 4.5 ± 0.3 cm, p = 0.8).

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and β-blockers are recommended first-line agents for heart failure. We hypothesized that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and β-blockers could prevent trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity. Patients and Methods In this double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive treatment with perindopril, bisoprolol, or placebo (1:1:1) for the duration of trastuzumab adjuvant therapy. Patients underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and post-cycle 17 for the determination of left ventricular volumes and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Cardiotoxicity was evaluated as the change in indexed left ventricular end diastolic volume and LVEF. Results Thirty-three patients received perindopril, 31 received bisoprolol, and 30 received placebo. Baseline demographic, cancer, and cardiovascular profiles were similar between groups. Study drugs were well tolerated with no serious adverse events. After 17 cycles of trastuzumab, indexed left ventricular end diastolic volume increased in patients treated with perindopril (+7 ± 14 mL/m2), bisoprolol (+8 mL ± 9 mL/m2), and placebo (+4 ± 11 mL/m2"; P = .36). In secondary analyses, trastuzumab-mediated decline in LVEF was attenuated in bisoprolol-treated patients (-1 ± 5%) relative to the perindopril (-3 ± 4%) and placebo (-5 ± 5%) groups ( P = .001). Perindopril and bisoprolol use were independent predictors of maintained LVEF on multivariable analysis. Conclusion Perindopril and bisoprolol were well tolerated in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer who received trastuzumab and protected against cancer therapy-related declines in LVEF;" however, trastuzumab-mediated left ventricular remodeling-the primary outcome-was not prevented by these pharmacotherapies."",""Multidisciplinary Approach to Novel Therapies in Cardio-Oncology Research (MANTICORE 101–Breast): A Randomized Trial for the Prevention of Trastuzumab-Associated CardiotoxicityThe following represents disclosure information provided by authors of this manuscript.

The primary objective of this study was to compare cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) versus echocardiography (ECHO) to detect a reduction in left ventricular ejection function, suggestive of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. We studied eligible patients who were 18 years or older, who had breast cancer or lymphoma, and who were offered treatment with doxorubicin with curative intent dosing of 240 to 300 mg/m 2 body surface area between March 1, 2009 and October 31, 2013. Patients underwent baseline CMRI and ECHO. Both imaging studies were repeated after four cycles of treatment. Ejection fraction (EF) calculated by both methods was compared and analyzed with the inferential statistical Student's t test. Twenty-eight eligible patients were enrolled. Two patients stopped participating in the study before undergoing baseline CMRI";" 26 patients underwent baseline ECHO and CMRI. Eight of those 26 patients declined posttreatment studies, so the final study population was 18 patients. There was a significant difference in EF pre- and posttreatment in the CMRI group ( p  = 0.009) versus the ECHO group that showed no significant differences in EF ( p  = NS). It appears that CMRI is superior to ECHO for detecting doxorubicin-induced reductions in cardiac systolic function. However, ECHO is less expensive and more convenient for patients because of its noninvasive character and bedside practicality. A larger study is needed to confirm these findings."",,""Funding Mayo Clinic Health System—Franciscan Healthcare Foundation, Grant/Award Number: “09–032”, “13–04”."",International Journal of Angiology,,,,2019-10-11,2019,2019-10-11,2020-03,29,01,045-051,All OA";" Green,Article,""Tak, Tahir"; Jaekel, Camilla; Gharacholou, Shahyar; Dworak, Marshall;" Marshall, Scott"",""Tak, Tahir (Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota"; Department of Cardiology, Mayo Clinic Health System-Franciscan Healthcare in La Crosse, La Crosse, Wisconsin); Jaekel, Camilla (Department of Nursing, Mayo Clinic Health System-Franciscan Healthcare in La Crosse, La Crosse, Wisconsin); Gharacholou, Shahyar (Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota); Dworak, Marshall (Department of Cardiology, Mayo Clinic Health System-Franciscan Healthcare in La Crosse, La Crosse, Wisconsin);" Marshall, Scott (Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic Health System-Franciscan Healthcare in La Crosse, La Crosse, Wisconsin)"",,""Tak, Tahir (Mayo Clinic"; Mayo Clinic Health System); Jaekel, Camilla (Mayo Clinic Health System); Gharacholou, Shahyar (Mayo Clinic); Dworak, Marshall (Mayo Clinic Health System);" Marshall, Scott (Mayo Clinic Health System)"",8,5,0.52,2.86,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7054057,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1121646953,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences"; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging (with ST) was performed at baseline and 6 m. We studied the correlation between 2DE-ST- and CMR-derived global longitudinal strain (GLS) and global radial strain (GRS) measured at the same time. Additionally, we associated baseline and 3 m 2DE-ST measurements with later CMR-LVEF, and with cardiotoxicity, defined as CMR-LVEF < 45% and/or absolute decline > 10% during trastuzumab.ResultsForty-seven patients were included. Median baseline LVEF was 60.4%. GLS measurements based on 2DE-ST and CMR showed weak correlation (Pearson’s r = 0.33"; p = 0.041); GRS measurements were uncorrelated (r = 0.09; p = 0.979). 2DE-LVEF at baseline and 3 m, and 2DE-ST-GLS at 3 m were predictive of CMR-LVEF at 6 m. In contrast, the change in 2DE-ST-GLS at 3 m was predictive of the change in CMR-LVEF at 6 m, whereas the change in 2DE-LVEF was not. Importantly, the 11 patients who developed cardiotoxicity (28%) had larger 2DE-ST-GLS change at 3 m than those who did not (median 5.2%-points versus 1.7%-points; odds ratio for 1% difference change 1.81, 95% confidence interval 1.11–2.93; p = 0.016;" explained variance 0.34).ConclusionsCorrelations between 2DE-ST and CMR-derived measurements are weak. Nevertheless, ST-measurements appeared useful to improve the performance of 2DE in predicting LVEF changes after 6 m of trastuzumab treatment."",""We thank Astrid Gundlach and Lianne Stomp – van de Burgt for their valuable help with the echocardiographic images, and Sylvia Sprangers for her assistance with identifying patients in the Albert Schweitzer Hospital."",""This study was funded by the Promotiefonds of the Albert Schweitzer Hospital, Dordrecht, The Netherlands.

This study aimed to analyze myocardial injury using serial laboratory and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) parameters after epirubicin-based chemotherapy compared with left-sided radiotherapy and to study their value for early prediction of CTRCD.MethodsSixty-six consecutive women (53 ± 13 years) including n = 39 with epirubicin-based chemotherapy and n = 27 with left-sided radiotherapy were prospectively studied by 3 T CMR including left ventricular (LV) mass and volumes for ejection fraction (LVEF), as well as feature-tracking with global longitudinal strain (GLS) and T1/T2 mapping. CMR was performed at baseline, at therapy completion (follow-up 1, FU1), and after 13 ± 2 months (FU2). CTRCD was defined as LVEF decline of at least 10% to < 55% or a > 15% GLS change at FU2.ResultsT1 and T2 increased at FU1 after epirubicin-based chemotherapy, but not after left-sided radiotherapy. CTRCD occurred in 20% of patients after epirubicin-based chemotherapy and in 4% after left-sided radiotherapy. T1 at FU1 was the best single parameter to predict CTRCD with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.712 (CI 0.587–0.816, p = 0.005) with excellent sensitivity (100%, 66–100%), but low specificity (44%, 31–58%). Combined use of increased T1 and LVEF ≤ 60% at FU1 improved AUC to 0.810 (0.695–0.896) resulting in good sensitivity (78%, 44–95%) and specificity (84%, 72–92%).ConclusionOnly epirubicin-based chemotherapy, but not left-sided radiotherapy, resulted in increased T1/T2 myocardial relaxation times as a marker of myocardial injury. Combined use of CMR parameters may allow an early prediction of subsequent CTCRD.Key Points• Myocardial T1 and T2 relaxation times increased at FU1 after epirubicin-based chemotherapy, but not after left-sided radiotherapy.• Cancer therapy–related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) occurred in 20% of patients after epirubicin-based chemotherapy and in 4% after left-sided radiotherapy.• Combined use of increased T1 and reduced LVEF had an AUC of 0.810 (0.695–0.896) to predict CTRCD with good sensitivity (78%, 44–95%) and specificity (84%, 72–92%)."",,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

BACKGROUND: Serum biomarkers of cardiac dysfunction, although elevated after chemotherapy, lack specificity for the mechanism of myocardial tissue alterations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
METHODS: A total of 27 women with breast cancer (mean age 51.8 ± 8.9 years, mean body mass index 26.9 ± 3.6 kg/m2), underwent cardiac magnetic resonance before and up to 3 times after anthracycline therapy. Cardiac magnetic resonance variables were LV ejection fraction, normalized T2-weighted signal intensity for myocardial edema, extracellular volume (ECV), LV cardiomyocyte mass, intracellular water lifetime (τic; a marker of cardiomyocyte size), and late gadolinium enhancement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RESULTS: At baseline, patients had a relatively low (10-year) Framingham cardiovascular event risk (median 5%), normal LV ejection fractions (mean 69.4 ± 3.6%), and normal LV mass index (51.4 ± 8.0 g/m2), a mean ECV of 0.32 ± 0.038, mean τic of 169 ± 69 ms, and no late gadolinium enhancement. At 351 to 700 days after anthracycline therapy (240 mg/m2), mean LV ejection fraction had declined by 12% to 58 ± 6% (p < 0.001) and mean LV mass index by 19 g/m2 to 36 ± 6 g/m2 (p < 0.001), and mean ECV had increased by 0.037 to 0.36 ± 0.04 (p = 0.004), while mean τic had decreased by 62 ms to 119 ± 54 ms (p = 0.004). Myocardial edema peaked at about 146 to 231 days (p < 0.001). LV mass index was associated with τic (β = 4.1 ± 1.5 g/m2 per 100-ms increase in τic, p = 0.007) but not with ECV. Cardiac troponin T (mean 4.6 ± 1.4 pg/ml at baseline) increased significantly after anthracycline treatment (p < 0.001). Total LV cardiomyocyte mass, estimated as: (1 - ECV) × LV mass, declined more rapidly after anthracycline therapy, with peak cardiac troponin T >10 pg/ml. There was no evidence for any significant interaction between 10-year cardiovascular event risk and the effect of anthracycline therapy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CONCLUSIONS: A decrease in LV mass after anthracycline therapy may result from cardiomyocyte atrophy, demonstrating that mechanisms other than interstitial fibrosis and edema can raise ECV. The loss of LV cardiomyocyte mass increased with the degree of cardiomyocyte injury, assessed by peak cardiac troponin T after anthracycline treatment.

Limited data focus on dynamic myocardial injury during the course of chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PURPOSE: To investigate the variation of tissue characterization and myocardial deformation derived by cardiac MRI during anthracycline chemotherapy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
STUDY TYPE: Prospective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
POPULATION: Fifty-eight female breast cancer patients (mean age: 52.82 ± 2.61 years) were enrolled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: A 3.0-T, cardiac MRI including cine balanced steady-state free precession, a modified Looker-Locker inversion recovery (MOLLI), and a fast spin echo (FSE) T2-weighted sequences were performed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ASSESSMENT: Cardiac MRI was performed baseline and after two, four, and six cycles of chemotherapy. Assessment of global longitudinal strain (GLS), global circumstance strain (GCS), global radial strain (GRS), and strain rate (GLS-s, GCS-s, GRS-s) and T1, T2 and T2* were accomplished by CVI42. The anthracycline dose and risk factors were also collected before each cardiac MRI.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
STATISTICAL TESTS: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures was used to compare the changes in LVEF cardiac function, strain and T1/T2/T2* parameters over time. Pearson correlation analyses were performed to estimate the potential associations between differences in myocardial characteristics (∆) and the chemotherapy cycle. A P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RESULTS: LVEF was not significantly different from pretreatment MRI regarding each cycle of chemotherapy (P = 0.54). Compared with baseline, patients had significantly lower GLS (-15.85% ± 0.83%, -14.50% ± 0.88%, -12.34% ± 1.01% vs. -18.82% ± 0.92%) and GLS-s (-0.71% ± 0.07%, -0.65% ± 0.05%, -0.64% ± 0.04% vs. -0.95 ± 0.06%) and increased T2 values (57.21 ± 4.27 msec, 58.60 ± 3.93 msec, 58.10 ± 3.17 msec vs. 43.88 ± 3.28 msec) at two, four and six cycles of chemotherapy treatment. ∆GLS and ∆GLS-s were significantly associated with the chemotherapy cycle (correlation coefficients for GLS = 0.75, GLS-s = 0.75).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DATA CONCLUSION: Cardiac MRI can precisely detect the dynamic changes of anthracycline-induced subclinical myocardial injury that is represented as a gradually decrease in GLS and GLS-s. These parameters may provide new insight for monitoring risk and therapy in patients with breast cancer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The main hypothesis based on the patients receiving antineoplastic chemotherapy treatment was CTRCD risk analysis with GLS that was independent of LV ejection fraction (LVEF).";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
METHODS: Displacement Encoding with Stimulated Echoes (DENSE) MRI was acquired on 32 breast cancer patients at baseline and 3- and 6-month follow-ups after chemotherapy. Two DeepLabV3+ Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) were deployed to automate image segmentation for LV chamber quantification and phase-unwrapping for 3D strains, computed with the Radial Point Interpolation Method. CTRCD risk (cardiotoxicity and adverse cardiac events) was analyzed with Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) models with clinical and contractile prognostic factors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RESULTS: GLS worsened from baseline to the 3- and 6-month follow-ups (-19.1 ± 2.1%, -16.0 ± 3.1%, -16.1 ± 3.0%; P < 0.001). Univariable Cox regression showed the 3-month GLS significantly associated as an agonist (hazard ratio [HR]-per-SD: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.4-3.1; P < 0.001) and LVEF as a protector (HR-per-SD: 0.8; 95% CI: 0.7-0.9; P = 0.001) for CTRCD occurrence. Bivariable regression showed the 3-month GLS (HR-per-SD: 2.0; 95% CI: 1.2-3.4; P = 0.01) as a CTRCD prognostic factor independent of other covariates, including LVEF (HR-per-SD: 1.0; 95% CI: 0.9-1.2; P = 0.9).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

For women with breast cancer, a short-term strategy may be more feasible and appealing, as maintaining regular exercise training or a diet throughout chemotherapy can be challenging due to treatment symptoms and psychosocial distress.MethodsThe Caloric Restriction and Exercise protection from Anthracycline Toxic Effects (CREATE) study will determine whether acute application of these interventions shortly prior to receipt of each treatment can reduce anthracycline-related toxicity to the heart, aorta, and skeletal muscle. Fifty-six women with early stage breast cancer scheduled to receive anthracycline treatment will be randomly assigned to one of three groups who will: 1) perform a single, 30-min, vigorous-intensity, aerobic exercise session 24 h prior to each anthracycline treatment"; 2) consume a prepared diet reduced to 50% of caloric needs for 48 h prior to each anthracycline treatment; or 3) receive usual cancer care. The primary outcome is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) derived left ventricular ejection fraction reserve (peak exercise LVEF – resting LVEF) at the end of anthracycline treatment. Secondary outcomes include MRI-derived measures of cardiac, aortic and skeletal muscle structure and function, circulating NT-proBNP, cardiorespiratory fitness and treatment symptoms. Exploratory outcomes include quality of life, fatigue, tumor size (only in neoadjuvant patients), oxidative stress and antioxidants, as well as clinical cardiac or cancer outcomes. MRI, exercise tests, and questionnaires will be administered before, 2–3 weeks after the last anthracycline treatment, and one-year follow-up.DiscussionThe proposed lifestyle interventions are accessible, low cost, drug-free potential methods for mitigating anthracycline-related toxicity. Reduced toxic effects on the heart, aorta and muscle are very likely to translate to short and long-term cardiovascular health benefits, including enhanced resilience to the effects of subsequent cancer treatment (e.g., radiation, trastuzumab) aging, and infection.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT03131024;" 4/21/18."",""This study is funded by a Susan G.

Displacement Encoding with Stimulated Echoes cardiac image phases acquired from 30 breast cancer patients and 30 healthy females were unwrapped via a DeepLabV3 + fully convolutional network (FCN). Myocardial strains were directly computed from the unwrapped phases with the Radial Point Interpolation Method. FCN-unwrapped phases of a phantom's rotating gel were validated against quality-guided phase-unwrapping (QGPU) and robust transport of intensity equation (RTIE) phase-unwrapping. FCN performance on unwrapping human LV data was measured with F1 and Dice scores versus QGPU ground-truth. The reliability of FCN-based strains was assessed against RTIE-based strains with Cronbach's alpha (C-α) intraclass correlation coefficient. Mean squared error (MSE) of unwrapping the phantom experiment data at 0 dB signal-to-noise ratio were 1.6, 2.7 and 6.1 with FCN, QGPU and RTIE techniques. Human data classification accuracies were F1 = 0.95 (Dice = 0.96) with FCN and F1 = 0.94 (Dice = 0.95) with RTIE. GLS results from FCN and RTIE were -16 ± 3% vs. -16 ± 3% (C-α = 0.9) for patients and -20 ± 3% vs. -20 ± 3% (C-α = 0.9) for healthy subjects. The low MSE from the phantom validation demonstrates accuracy of phase-unwrapping with the FCN and comparable human subject results versus RTIE demonstrate GLS analysis accuracy. A deep-learning methodology for phase-unwrapping in medical images and GLS computation was developed and validated in a heterogeneous cohort."",""Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

RESULTS: In post-chemotherapy CMR, 4 patients (19.04%), three symptomatic and one asymptomatic, exhibited evidence of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. Significant differences in biventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular end-systolic volume index, and all 3D global strain values were noted after chemotherapy in comparison with the baseline (all P < 0.05). More than half of the study population showed a significant change in all right ventricular global strain values. One patient (4.76%) exhibited evidence of diffuse myocardial edema in post-chemotherapy CMR, and 3 patients (14.28%) showed myocardial fibrosis.

"5295,pub.1112770769,,30874405,,Primary Care of Breast Cancer Survivors.,""With declining mortality rates, the number of breast cancer survivors is increasing. Ongoing care after breast cancer treatment is often provided by primary care physicians. This care includes surveillance for cancer recurrence with a history and physical examination every three to six months for the first three years after treatment, every six to 12 months for two more years, and annually thereafter. Mammography is performed annually. Magnetic resonance imaging of the breast is not indicated unless patients are at high risk of recurrence, such as having a hereditary cancer syndrome. Many breast cancer survivors experience long-term sequelae from the disease or treatment. Premature menopause with hot flashes can occur and is managed with pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments. Vaginal dryness is treated with vaginal lubricants and gels. Because cardiotoxicity from chemotherapy is possible, clinicians should be alert for this complication and perform echocardiography if appropriate. Impaired cognition after chemotherapy is also common";" treatment includes cognitive rehabilitation therapy. Patients with treatment-induced menopause develop decreased bone density and should receive dual energy x-ray absorptiometry and pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies. Others experience lymphedema, often best managed with weight loss and complex decongestive therapy. Some women develop chronic pain, which is treated by addressing psychological factors and with appropriate pharmacologic therapy."",,,American Family Physician,,,""Breast Neoplasms"; Cancer Survivors; Chronic Pain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Female; Humans; Lymphedema; Mammography; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Primary Health Care;" Risk Factors"",2019-03-15,2019,,2019-03-15,99,6,370-375,Closed,Article,""Zoberi, Kimberly";" Tucker, Jane"",""Zoberi, Kimberly (Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.)";" Tucker, Jane (Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.)"",,""Zoberi, Kimberly (Saint Louis University)";" Tucker, Jane (Saint Louis University)"",10,4,0.43,4.03,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1112770769,4203 Health Services and Systems"; 4205 Nursing; 42 Health Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Left ventricular ejection fraction, global and regional strain utilizing fast-strain-encoded, T1 and T2 mapping, and cardiac biomarkers (troponin and BNP [brain natriuretic peptide]) were analyzed.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
METHODS: Sixty-one patients (47 with breast cancer, 11 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and 3 with Hodgkin lymphoma) underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance scans at baseline and at regular intervals during 2 years of follow-up. The percentage of all left ventricular myocardial segments with strain ≤-17% (normal myocardium [%]) was analyzed. Clinical cardiotoxicity (CTX) and sub-CTX were defined according to standard measures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RESULTS: Nine (15%) patients developed CTX, 26 (43%) had sub-CTX. Of the 35 patients with CTX or sub-CTX, 24 (69%) were treated with cardioprotective medications and showed recovery of cardiac function. The amount of normal myocardium (%) exhibited markedly higher accuracy for the detection of CTX and sub-CTX compared with left ventricular ejection fraction, T1, and T2 mapping as well as troponin I (Δareas under the curve=0.20, 0.24, and 0.46 for normal myocardium (%) versus left ventricular ejection fraction, troponin I, and T1 mapping, P<0.001 for all).

Fourty-one women with early stage HER2+ breast cancer underwent serial CMR (baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months) after initiation of trastuzumab therapy. A single, blinded observer measured LV parameters on de-identified CMRs in random order. Linear mixed models were used to investigate temporal changes. Compared to baseline, there were significant decreases in systolic function as measured by both left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (p <0.001 at 6 and 12 months) and peak ejection rate corrected for end-diastolic volume (PER/LVEDV) (p = 0.008 at 6 months, p = 0.01 at 12 months). However, these differences were no longer significant at 18 months. In contrast, significant reductions in diastolic function as measured by LV peak filling rate corrected for end-diastolic volume (PFR/LVEDV) were observed at 6 months (p = 0.012), 12 months (p = 0.031), and up to 18 months (p = 0.034). There were no significant temporal changes in the time to peak filling rate corrected for cardiac cycle (TPF/RR). The reduction in PFR/LVEDV at 18 months was no longer significant when corrected for heart rate. In conclusion, there were significant subclinical deleterious effects on both LV systolic and diastolic function among patients receiving trastuzumab. While there was recovery in LV systolic function after therapy cessation at 18 months, reduction in PFR/LVEDV appeared to persist. Thus, diastolic dysfunction may serve as a marker of trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity that needs to be confirmed in a larger study."",""We thank all the study coordinators and patients who participated in this study.

Beta-adrenergic receptor blocker and renin-angiotensin system inhibitor therapies have been associated with modest cardioprotective effects in unselected patients receiving anthracycline chemotherapy.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
METHODS: In a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point trial, patients with breast cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma receiving anthracycline chemotherapy underwent serial high-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging before and 6 months after anthracycline treatment. Patients at high risk of cardiotoxicity (cardiac troponin I concentrations in the upper tertile during chemotherapy) were randomized to standard care plus cardioprotection (combination carvedilol and candesartan therapy) or standard care alone. The primary outcome was adjusted change in left ventricular ejection fraction at 6 months. In low-risk nonrandomized patients with cardiac troponin I concentrations in the lower 2 tertiles, we hypothesized the absence of a 6-month change in left ventricular ejection fraction and tested for equivalence of ±2%.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RESULTS: Between October 2017 and June 2021, 175 patients (mean age, 53 years; 87% female; 71% with breast cancer) were recruited. Patients randomized to cardioprotection (n=29) or standard care (n=28) had left ventricular ejection fractions of 69.4±7.4% and 69.1±6.1% at baseline and 65.7±6.6% and 64.9±5.9% 6 months after completion of chemotherapy, respectively. After adjustment for age, pretreatment left ventricular ejection fraction, and planned anthracycline dose, the estimated mean difference in 6-month left ventricular ejection fraction between the cardioprotection and standard care groups was -0.37% (95% CI, -3.59% to 2.85%; P=0.82). In low-risk nonrandomized patients, baseline and 6-month left ventricular ejection fractions were 69.3±5.7% and 66.4±6.3%, respectively: estimated mean difference, 2.87% (95% CI, 1.63%-4.10%; P=0.92, not equivalent).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CONCLUSIONS: Combination candesartan and carvedilol therapy had no demonstrable cardioprotective effect in patients receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy with high-risk on-treatment cardiac troponin I concentrations. Low-risk nonrandomized patients had similar declines in left ventricular ejection fraction, bringing into question the utility of routine cardiac troponin monitoring. Furthermore, the modest declines in left ventricular ejection fraction suggest that the value and clinical impact of early cardioprotection therapy need to be better defined in patients receiving high-dose anthracycline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This study aimed to evaluate the early signs of diffuse fibrosis after RT and their evolution during a six-year follow-up.MethodsThirty patients with early-stage left-sided breast cancer were studied with echocardiography and electrocardiography (ECG) at baseline, after RT, and at three-year and six-year follow-up visits. Echocardiography analysis included an off-line analysis of integrated backscatter (IBS). ECG was analysed for fragmented QRS (fQRS). In addition, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging was performed at the six-year control. The left ventricle 16-segment model was used in cardiac imaging, and respective local radiation doses were analysed.ResultsRegional myocardial reflectivity in inferoseptal segments increased by 2.02 (4.53) dB (p = 0.026) and the percentage of leads with fQRS increased from 9.2 to 16.4% (p = 0.002) during the follow-up. In CMR imaging, abnormal extracellular volume (ECV) and T1 mapping values were found with anteroseptal and apical localization in a median of 3.5 (1.00–5.75) and 3 (1.25–4.00) segments, respectively. A higher left ventricle radiation dose was associated with an increased likelihood of having changes simultaneously in CMR and echocardiography (OR 1.26, 95% Cl. 1.00–1.59, p = 0.047).ConclusionsAfter radiotherapy, progressive changes in markers of diffuse myocardial fibrosis were observed in a multimodal manner in ECG and echocardiography. Changes in echocardiography and abnormal values in CMR were localized in the septal and apical regions, and multiple changes were associated with higher radiation doses."",""The authors would thank the research nurses Virpi Palomäki, Hanna-Leena Näppilä, Kati Helleharju, and Katri Mikkonen for their expert assistance during the study."",""This study received funding from non-profit trusts: Paavo and Eila Salonen Legacy, Georg and Ella Ehrnrooth Legacy, Aarne Koskelo Legacy, Elli and Elvi Oksanen Legacy, Finnish Cultural Foundation Pirkanmaa Regional fund, the Competitive State Research Financing of the Expert Responsibility area of Tampere University Hospital and HUS Diagnostic Center fund.

We conducted a prospective, multi-centre, longitudinal observational study of 41 trastuzumab-treated breast cancer women who underwent serial CMR (baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months). Two blinded readers independently measured left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), peak systolic strain parameters (global longitudinal strain [GLS] and global circumferential strain [GCS]), and early diastolic strain rate parameters (global longitudinal diastolic strain rate [GLSR-E], global circumferential diastolic strain rate [GCSR-E], and global radial diastolic strain rate [GRSR-E]), by feature tracking (FT-CMR) using CMR42. There was a significant decline in peak systolic strain GLS and GCS at 6 months (p = 0.024 and p < 0.001, respectively) and 12 months (p = 0.002 and p < 0.001, respectively), followed by recovery at 18 months, which paralleled decline in LVEF at 6 months (p = 0.034) and 12 months (p = 0.012). Conversely, early diastolic strain rates GLSR-E and GCSR-E did not significantly change over 18 months (p > 0.10), while GRSR-E was marginally significant at 12 months (p = 0.021). There was no significant correlation between changes at 6 months in LVEF and GLSR-E or GRSR-E (p > 0.10), and a marginally significant weak correlation between LVEF and GCSR-E (p = 0.046). Among trastuzumab-treated patients without overt cardiotoxicity, there was no consistent temporal change in FT-CMR-derived diastolic strain rate parameters up to 18 months, in contrast to decline in systolic strain and LVEF. Systolic strains by FT-CMR are likely more useful than diastolic strain rates for monitoring subclinical trastuzumab-related myocardial dysfunction.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01022086."",""This study was funded by an operating grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and Roche.

Subclinical dysfunction otherwise undetected via LV ejection fraction (LVEF) was determined.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
METHODS: Deformation data were acquired with the Displacement Encoding with Stimulated Echoes (DENSE) MRI sequence on 16 female patients who had CTA-based treatment. The contractility analysis tool consisting of image quantization-based boundary detection and the meshfree Radial Point Interpolation Method was used to compare chamber quantifications, 3D regional strains and torsion between patients and healthy subjects (N = 26 females with N = 14 age-matched). Quantifications of patient LVEFs from DENSE and Steady-State Free Precession (SSFP) acquisitions were compared, Bland-Altman interobserver agreements measured on their strain results and differences in contractile parameters with healthy subjects determined via Student's t-tests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RESULTS: A significant difference was not found between DENSE and SSFP-based patient LVEFs at 58 ± 7% vs 57 ± 9%, p = 0.6. Bland-Altman agreements were - 0.01 ± 0.05 for longitudinal strain and 0.1 ± 1.3° for torsion. Differences in basal diameter indicating enlargement, 5.2 ± 0.5 cm vs 4.5 ± 0.5 cm, p < 0.01, and torsion, 4.7 ± 1.0° vs 8.1 ± 1.1°, p < 0.001 in the mid-ventricle and 5.9 ± 1.2° vs 10.2 ± 0.9°, p < 0.001 apically, were seen between patients and age-matched healthy subjects and similarly in longitudinal strain, but not in LVEF.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Therefore, we sought to evaluate the temporal changes in right ventricular (RV) structure and function as measured by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), and their relationship with left ventricular (LV) structure and function in breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab.MethodsProspective, longitudinal, observational study involving 41 women with HER2+ breast cancer who underwent serial CMR at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months after initiation of trastuzumab. A single blinded observer measured RV parameters on de-identified CMRs in a random order. Linear mixed models were used to investigate temporal changes in RV parameters.ResultsOf the 41 women (age 52 ± 11 years), only one patient experienced trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity. Compared to baseline, there were small but significant increases in the RV end-diastolic volume at 6 months (p = 0.002) and RV end-systolic volume at 6 and 12 months (p < 0.001 for both), but not at 18 months (p = 0.82 and 0.13 respectively). RV ejection fraction (RVEF), when compared to baseline (58.3%, 95% CI 57.1–59.5%), showed corresponding decreases at 6 months (53.9%, 95% CI 52.5–55.4%, p < 0.001) and 12 months (55%, 95% CI 53.8–56.2%, p < 0.001) that recovered at 18 months (56.6%, 95% CI 55.1–58.0%, p = 0.08). Although the temporal pattern of changes in LVEF and RVEF were similar, there was no significant correlation between RVEF and LVEF at baseline (r = 0.29, p = 0.07) or between their changes at 6 months (r = 0.24, p = 0.17).ConclusionIn patients receiving trastuzumab without overt cardiotoxicity, there is a subtle but significant deleterious effect on RV structure and function that recover at 18 months, which can be detected by CMR. Furthermore, monitoring of LVEF alone may not be sufficient in detecting early RV injury. These novel findings provide further support for CMR in monitoring early cardiotoxicity.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01022086.

We prospectively assessed heart changes after 3D conformal RT (3DCRT) and IMRT for left-sided breast cancer. Heart dose was analyzed individually, 3DCRT patients were moderately exposed, and IMRT was performed only in patients with unacceptably high heart doses upon 3DCRT planning.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 49 patients (38 patients received 3DCRT; 11 patients received IMRT; and 20 patients received neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and echocardiography were performed before and at 6, 12, and 24 months after treatment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RESULTS: Mean heart dose for IMRT was 12.9 ± 3.9 Gy versus 4.5 ± 2.4 Gy for 3DCRT. Heart volumes receiving >40 Gy were 2.6% (3DCRT) versus 1.3% (IMRT); doses were >50 Gy only with 3DCRT. Temporary ejection fraction (EF) decrease was observed on MRI after 6 months (63%-59%, P=.005) resolving at 24 months. Only 3 patients had pronounced largely transient changes of EF and left ventricular enddiastolic diameter (LVEDD). Mitral (M) and tricuspid (T) annular plane systolic excursion (MAPSE and TAPSE) were reduced over the whole cohort (still within normal range). After 24 months left ventricular remodeling index decreased in patients receiving chemotherapy (0.80 vs 0.70, P=.028). Neither wall motion abnormalities nor late enhancements were found. On echocardiography, in addition to EF findings that were similar to those on MRI, global strain was unchanged over the whole cohort at 24 months after a transient decrease at 6 and 12 months. Longitudinal strain decreased in the whole cohort after 24 months in some segments, whereas it increased in others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of anthracyclines on the RV using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). This was a post-hoc analysis of a prospective study of 27 breast cancer (BC) patients (51.8 ± 8.9 years) using CMR prior, and up to 3-times after anthracyclines (240 mg/m2) to measure RV volumes and mass, RV extracellular volume (ECV) and cardiomyocyte mass (CM). Before anthracyclines, LVEF (69.4 ± 3.6%) and RVEF (55.6 ± 9%) were normal. The median follow-up after anthracyclines was 399 days (IQR 310–517). The RVEF reached its nadir (46.3 ± 6.8%) after 9-months (P < 0.001). RV mass-index and RV CM decreased to 13 ± 2.8 g/m2 and 8.13 ± 2 g/m2, respectively, at 16-months after anthracyclines. The RV ECV expanded from 0.26 ± 0.07 by 0.14 (53%) to 0.40 ± 0.1 (P < 0.001). The RV ECV expansion correlated with a decrease in RV mass-index (r = −0.46";" P < 0.001) and the increase in CK-MB. An RV ESV index at baseline above its median predicted an increased risk of LV dysfunction post-anthracyclines.

Clinically, statin use is associated with a lower risk for heart failure in breast cancer patients with anthracycline chemotherapy. So, the purpose of our study was to investigate whether survivin mediates the protective effect of statin against anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
METHODS: Mice were treated once a week with 5 mg/kg doxorubicin for 4 weeks with or without atorvastatin 20 mg/kg every day then heart tissues were analyzed. Molecular and cellular biology analyses were performed with H9c2 cell lysates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RESULTS: Doxorubicin suppressed survivin expression via activation of FOXO1 in H9c2 cardiomyocytes. Whereas, atorvastatin inhibited FOXO1 by increasing phosphorylation and inhibiting nuclear localization. Doxorubicin induced FOXO1 binding to STAT3 and prevented STAT3 from interacting with Sp1. However, atorvastatin inhibited these interactions and stabilized STAT3/Sp1 transcription complex. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that doxorubicin decreased STAT3/Sp1 complex binding to survivin promoter, whereas atorvastatin stabilized this binding. In mouse model, atorvastatin rescued doxorubicin-induced reduction of survivin expression and of heart function measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, cardiotoxicity remains an important side effect.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
METHODS: We re-consented node-positive BC patients enrolled in a phase III trial between 1988 and 1996 which compared six cycles of oral cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil (CMF) versus two epirubicin-cyclophosphamide regimens differing by the anthracycline cumulative dose [standard-dose epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (SDE) (8 × 60 mg/m(2)) and higher-dose epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (HDE) (8 × 100 mg/m(2))]. Eligible patients were those who were alive and free of disease and had no contra-indications to the proposed tests (cardiac evaluation). Cardiotoxicity was defined as asymptomatic systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)< 50%, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class I) or symptomatic heart failure (NYHA Class II-IV). Differences in cardiotoxicity between CMF and SDE/HDE were assessed using chi-square and Fisher Exact tests for binary variables and t-test and Wilcoxon test for continuous variables.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RESULTS: Among the 777 patients, 20 cases of CHF were reported (CMF = 1, SDE = 5, HDE = 14; p < 0.001). Between September 2010 and June 2013, 82 patients (30%) out of 269 eligible patients accepted to participate in this substudy. Median follow-up was 18 years (range 15-24). Epirubicin-treated patients had significantly higher heart rate, more abnormal echocardiograms and LVEF by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compared to CMF-treated ones. A trend towards higher BNP was also observed in the SDE/HDE group (P = 0.08). No differences were observed in LVEF assessed by echocardiogram or troponin T levels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"CONCLUSIONS: Participation rate in this substudy was lower than expected highlighting the complexity of re-calling patients several years after the initial BC diagnosis. After 18 years, epirubicin-treated patients had a lower LVEF by MRI, more abnormal echocardiograms, higher heart rates compared to patients treated with CMF. However, no major delayed cardiotoxicity was observed."",""AcknowledgementsThis research has received grants from Les Amis de L’institut Bordet and la Fondation Contre le Cancer (2010-191), Brussels, Belgium.

The association of cardiac biomarkers with CMR left ventricular (LV) function and volume is also not well studied. Our objectives were to compare CMR and MUGA for left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment, and to examine the association between changes in brain natriuretic peptide (NT-BNP) and troponin-I and changes in CMR LV function and volume. This prospective longitudinal two-centre cohort study recruited HER2+ breast cancer patients between January 2010 and December 2013. MUGA, CMR, NT-BNP and troponin-I were performed at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months after trastuzumab initiation. In total, 41 patients (age 51.7 ± 10.8 years) were enrolled. LVEF comparison between MUGA and CMR demonstrated weak agreement (Lin’s correlation coefficient r = 0.46, baseline"; r = 0.29, 6 months; r = 0.42, 12 months; r = 0.39, 18 months;" all p < 0.05). Bland–Altman plots demonstrated wide LVEF agreement limits (pooled agreement limits 3.0 ± 6.2). Both modalities demonstrated significant LVEF decline at 6 and 12 months from baseline, concomitant with increased LV volumes on CMR. Changes in NT-BNP correlated with changes in LV diastolic volume at 12 and 18 months (p < 0.05), and LV systolic volume at 18 months (p < 0.05). Changes in troponin-I did not correlate with changes in LV function or volume at any timepoint. In conclusion, CMR and MUGA LVEF are not interchangeable, warranting selection and utility of one modality for serial monitoring. CMR is useful due to less radiation exposure and accuracy of LV volume measurements. Changes in NT-BNP correlated with changes in LV volumes."",We would like to thank all the study participants who contributed their time to this research study.

Observations suggest that regular exercise may be a useful therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular morbidity but it is yet to be interrogated in a large randomised trial.The primary aims of this study are to: 1) determine if 12-months of ET commenced at the onset of AC can reduce the proportion of BCa patients with functional disability (peak VO2, < 18 ml/kg/min), and 2) compare current standard-of-care for detecting cardiac dysfunction (resting left-ventricular ejection fraction assessed from 3-dimensional echocardiography) to measures of cardiac reserve (peak exercise cardiac output assessed from exercise cardiac magnetic resonance imaging) for predicting the development of functional disability 12-months following AC. Secondary aims are to assess the effects of ET on VO2peak, left ventricular morphology, vascular stiffness, cardiac biomarkers, body composition, bone mineral density, muscle strength, physical function, habitual physical activity, cognitive function, and multidimensional quality of life.MethodsOne hundred women with early-stage BCa (40–75 years) scheduled for AC will be randomized to 12-months of structured exercise training (n = 50) or a usual care control group (n = 50). Participants will be assessed at baseline, 4-weeks following completion of AC (4-months) and at 12-months for all measures.DiscussionWomen diagnosed with early-stage BCa have increased cardiac mortality. More sensitive strategies for diagnosing and preventing AC-induced cardiovascular impairment are critical for reducing cardiovascular morbidity and improving long-term health outcomes in BCa survivors.Trial registrationAustralia & New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR), ID: 12617001408370.

METHODS: A validated and automated MRI-based LV contractility analysis tool consisting of quantization-based boundary detection, unwrapping of image phases and the meshfree Radial Point Interpolation Method was used toward measuring LV chamber quantifications (LVCQ), three-dimensional strains and torsions in patients and healthy subjects. Data were acquired with the Displacement Encoding with Stimulated Echoes (DENSE) sequence on 21 female patients and 21 age-matched healthy females. Estimates of patient LVCQs from DENSE acquisitions were validated in comparison to similar steady-state free precession measurements and their strain results validated via Bland-Altman interobserver agreements. The occurrence of LV abnormalities was investigated via significant differences in contractility measurements (LVCQs, strains and torsions) between patients and healthy subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RESULTS: Repeated measures analysis showed similarities between LVCQ measurements from DENSE and steady-state free precession, including cardiac output (4.7 ± 0.4 L, 4.6 ± 0.4 L, p = 0.8), and LV ejection fractions (59±6%, 58±5%, p = 0.2). Differences found between patients and healthy subjects included enlarged basal diameter (5.0 ± 0.5 cm vs 4.4 ± 0.5 cm, p < 0.01), apical torsion (6.0 ± 1.1° vs 9.7 ± 1.4°, p < 0.001) and global longitudinal strain (-0.15 ± 0.02 vs. -0.21 ± 0.04, p < 0.001), but not LV ejection fraction (59±6% vs. 63±6%, p = 0.1).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Experts currently recommend that systemic therapy is offered to elderly patients with BC, if, based on their overall conditions and life expectancy, it can be reasonably anticipated that the benefits will outweigh the risks of treatment. Like for young subjects, the monoclonal antibody against human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2), trastuzumab, represents a valid therapeutic option when BC over-expresses this receptor. Unfortunately, administration of trastuzumab is associated with the occurrence of left ventricular dysfunction and chronic heart failure (CHF), possibly because of interference with the homeostatic functions of HER-2 in the heart. Registry-based, retrospective analyses have reported an incidence of CHF around 25% in elderly women receiving trastuzumab compared with 10%-15% in those not given any therapy for BC, and the risk of CHF has been estimated to be two-fold higher in > 60-65 year old trastuzumab users vs. non-users. Extremely advanced age and preexisting cardiac disease have been shown to predispose to trastuzumab cardiotoxicity. Therefore, selection of older patients for treatment with trastuzumab should be primarily based on their general status and the presence of comorbidities";" previous chemotherapy, especially with anthracyclines, should be also taken into account. Once therapy has started, efforts should be made to ensure regular cardiac surveillance. The role of selected biomarkers, such as cardiac troponin, or new imaging techniques (three-dimension, tissue Doppler echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging) is promising, but must be further investigated especially in the elderly. Moreover, additional studies are needed in order to better understand the mechanisms by which trastuzumab affects the old heart."",,,Journal of Geriatric Cardiology,,,,2016-05,2016,,2016-05,13,4,355-363,Closed,Article,""Denegri, Andrea"; Moccetti, Tiziano; Moccetti, Marco; Spallarossa, Paolo; Brunelli, Claudio;" Ameri, Pietro"",""Denegri, Andrea (Cardiocentro Ticino Foundation, Lugano, Switzerland"; Cardiology Unit and Laboratory of Cardiovascular Biology, AOU-IRCCS San Martino-IST and Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genova, Genova, Italy); Moccetti, Tiziano (Cardiocentro Ticino Foundation, Lugano, Switzerland); Moccetti, Marco (Cardiocentro Ticino Foundation, Lugano, Switzerland); Spallarossa, Paolo (Cardiology Unit and Laboratory of Cardiovascular Biology, AOU-IRCCS San Martino-IST and Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genova, Genova, Italy); Brunelli, Claudio (Cardiology Unit and Laboratory of Cardiovascular Biology, AOU-IRCCS San Martino-IST and Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genova, Genova, Italy);" Ameri, Pietro (Cardiology Unit and Laboratory of Cardiovascular Biology, AOU-IRCCS San Martino-IST and Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genova, Genova, Italy)"",,""Denegri, Andrea (Swiss Institute for Regenerative Medicine"; University of Genoa); Moccetti, Tiziano (Swiss Institute for Regenerative Medicine); Moccetti, Marco (Swiss Institute for Regenerative Medicine); Spallarossa, Paolo (University of Genoa); Brunelli, Claudio (University of Genoa);" Ameri, Pietro (University of Genoa)"",26,5,0.88,4.93,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1003043896,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences"; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,3 Good Health and Well Being;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Our previous work in 46 prospectively enrolled breast cancer patients showed early left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) function decline at 1 and 3 months, but only persistent RV dysfunction at 12 months which correlated with myocardial oedema observed early (1 and 3 months) after administration of chemotherapy regimes.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
METHOD: To investigate late cardiac effects, the same cohort were re-imaged with advanced Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging including T1 mapping 5 ± 1 year post chemotherapy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RESULTS: Twenty-six out of 46 (50%) patients underwent follow-up imaging. A statistical but non-clinically significant decrease was observed in LV ejection fraction (EF) from baseline to 5 years (72.2 ± 6.6 to 65.4 ± 9.3, p < 0.005). Subjects with initial drop of LVEF by >10% at 3 months (n = 5) or at 12 months (n = 3) did not demonstrate any difference in LV or RVEF at 5 years. No correlation was observed between myocardial oedema and LV or RVEF at 5 years. At 5 years, T1 values were within normal limits overall (935 ± 48 ms).

METHODS: Women with breast cancer scheduled for AC (n = 28) who participated in a nonrandomized trial of exercise training (ET; n = 14) or usual care (UC; n = 14) during AC completed a follow-up evaluation 12 months post-AC completion (16 months from baseline). At baseline, 4 months, and 16 months, participants underwent a resting echocardiogram (left ventricular ejection fraction; global longitudinal strain), a blood sample (troponin; B-type natriuretic peptide), a cardiopulmonary exercise test, and cardiac MRI measures of stroke volume (SV), heart rate, and cardiac output (Qc) at rest and during intense exercise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RESULTS: Seventeen women (UC, n = 8; ET, n = 9) completed evaluation at baseline, 4 months, and 16 months. At 4 months, AC was associated with 18% and 6% reductions in V˙O2peak in the UC and ET groups, respectively, which persisted at 16 months (UC, -16%; ET, -7%) and was not attenuated by ET (interaction, P = 0.10). Exercise Qc was lower at 16 months compared with baseline and 4 months (P < 0.001), which was due to a blunted augmentation of SV during exercise (P = 0.032; a 14% reduction in peak SV), with no changes in heart rate response. There was a small reduction in resting left ventricular ejection fraction (baseline to 4 months) and global longitudinal strain (between 4 and 16 months) and an increase in troponin (baseline to 4 months), but only exercise Qc was associated with V˙O2peak (R = 0.47, P < 0.01).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Methods and Results In a prospective, continuously recruited cohort of 95 patients scheduled to receive potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy for breast cancer, lymphoma, or soft tissue sarcoma, measures of left ventricular end-diastolic volume, LVESV, global circumferential strain, and LVEF were acquired via cardiac magnetic resonance imaging before and then 3 and 24 months after initiating treatment by individuals blinded to all patient identifiers. Participants had an average age of 54±15 years";" 68% were women, and 82% were of white race. LVEF declined from 62±7% to 58±9% over the 24 months (P<0.0001), with 42% of participants experiencing a >5% decline in LVEF at 24 months. Predictors of a 24-month >5% decline in LVEF included the following factors from baseline to 3 months into treatment: (1) >3-mL increases in LVESV (P=0.033), (2) >3-mL increases in LVESV or 10-mL declines in left ventricular end-diastolic volume with little change in LVESV (P=0.001), or (3) ≥10% deteriorations in global circumferential strain with little change in LVESV (P=0.036). Conclusion During receipt of potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy, increases in LVESV, the absence of its deterioration during decreases of left ventricular end-diastolic volume, or the deterioration of global circumferential strain without a marked decrease in LVESV help identify those who will develop more permanent 2-year declines in LVEF."",,,Journal of the American Heart Association,,,""Adult"; Aged; Antineoplastic Agents; Cardiotoxicity; Female; Heart Disease Risk Factors; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Prospective Studies; Stroke Volume; Time Factors; Ventricular Dysfunction, Left;" Ventricular Function, Left"",2020-01-21,2020,2020-01-21,2020-01-21,9,2,e015400,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Suerken, Cynthia K."; D'Agostino, Ralph B.; Jordan, Jennifer H.; Meléndez, Giselle C.; Vasu, Sujethra; Lamar, Zanetta S.;" Hundley, W.

BACKGROUND: Biomarkers and serial quantitative CMR tissue characterization may help identify early myocardial changes of CTRCD, but these parameters require both accuracy and reliability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
METHODS: A total of 50 participants (age 48.9 ± 12.1 years) underwent 3 CMR studies (1.5-T) and biomarker measurements (high-sensitivity troponin-I and B-type natriuretic peptide) at 3-month intervals: 20 with HER2-positive breast cancer (10 with and 10 without CTRCD), and 30 prospectively recruited healthy participants. T1 and T2 maps were obtained at 3 left ventricular short-axis locations. Temporal and observer variability were calculated as the coefficient of variation and as the standard error of the measurement (SEM) using repeated measures and 2-way analysis of variance. Minimal detected difference was defined as 2 × SEM.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RESULTS: Compared with the patients without CTRCD, those with CTRCD had larger temporal change in native T1 (27.2 ms [95% confidence interval (CI): 20.8 to 39.3 ms] vs. 12.4 ms [95% CI: 9.5 to 17.9 ms]), T2 (2.0 ms [95% CI: 1.5 to 2.9 ms] vs. 1.0 ms [95% CI: 0.74 to 1.4 ms]), and ECV (2.1% [95% CI: 1.5% to 3.1%] vs. 1.0% [95% CI: 0.8% to 1.5%]). However, the temporal changes in biomarkers overlapped. The minimal detected difference for T1 (29 ms), T2 (3.0 ms), and ECV (2.2%) in healthy participants approached the mean temporal changes in patients with CTRCD. For individual patients with CTRCD, there was overlap in the temporal changes of all 3 parameters, and the variability in healthy participants with the least overlap for native T1. The interobserver/intraobserver variabilities for the CMR parameters were low (coefficient of variation 0.5% to 4.3%).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"CONCLUSIONS: The temporal changes in both biomarkers and tissue characterization measures in individual patients overlap with the temporal variability in healthy participants and approach the minimal detectable temporal differences.

Using a new software algorithm, we sought to determine in individuals receiving treatment for cancer the association between automated assessments of LV mean mid-wall circumferential strain and conventional measures of LV ejection fraction (EF) both obtained from cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) cine balanced steady-state free-precession (bSSFP) white-blood acquisitions.MethodsBefore and 3 months after initiating treatment with potentially cardio-toxic chemotherapy, 72 individuals (aged 54 ± 14 years with breast cancer [39%], lymphoma [49%], or sarcoma [12%]) underwent serial CMR cine bSSFP assessments of LV volumes and EF, and mean mid-wall circumferential strain determined from these same cine images as well as from additional tagged CMR images. On the cine images, assessments of strain were obtained using the newly developed deformation-based segmentation algorithm. Assessments of LV volumes/EF from the cine images and strain from tagged CMR were accomplished using commercially available software. All measures were analyzed in a blinded fashion independent of one another.ResultsAcceptable measures for the automated assessments of mean mid-wall circumferential strain from the cine images were obtained in 142 of 144 visits (98.6%) with an overall analysis time averaging 6:47 ± 1:06 min. The results from these automated measures averaged −18.8 ± 2.9 at baseline and −17.6 ± 3.1 at 3 months (p = 0.001). Left ventricular EF declined slightly from 65 ± 7% at baseline to 62 ± 7% at 3 months (p = 0.0002). The correlation between strain from cine imaging and LVEF was r = −0.61 (p < 0.0001). In addition, the 3-month changes in LV strain and LVEF were correlated (r = −0.49"; p < 0.0001). The correlation between cine and tagged derived assessments of strain was r = 0.23;" p = 0.01.ConclusionsAutomated measures of LV mean mid-wall circumferential strain can be obtained in 6¾ minutes from cine bSSFP LV short-axis images (used concurrently to assess LV volumes and EF) in 98.6% of patients receiving treatment for cancer with potentially cardio-toxic chemotherapy. These cine derived measures of circumferential strain correlate with early subclinical declines in LVEF."",""We would like to thank Kimberly Lane for manually analyzing the cine images with the QMass software to generate the ejection fraction and manually analyzing the tagged images with the HARP software to generate the strain measures.

We sought to determine whether T1- and T2-weighted measures of signal intensity associate with decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction in human subjects receiving potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
METHODS AND RESULTS: In 65 individuals with breast cancer (n=51) or a hematologic malignancy (n=14), we measured left ventricular volumes, ejection fraction, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted and T2-weighted signal intensity before and 3 months after initiating potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy using blinded, unpaired analysis of cardiovascular magnetic resonance images. Participants were aged 51 ± 12 years, of whom 55% received an anthracycline, 38% received a monoclonal antibody, and 6% received an antimicrotubule agent. Overall, left ventricular ejection fraction decreased from 57 ± 6% to 54 ± 7% (P<0.001) because of an increase in end-systolic volume (P<0.05). T1-weighted signal intensities also increased from 14.1 ± 5.1 to 15.9 ± 6.8 (P<0.05), with baseline values trending higher among individuals who received chemotherapy before study enrollment (P=0.06). Changes in T1-weighted signal intensity did not differ within the 17 LV myocardial segments (P=0.97). Myocardial edema quantified from T2-weighted images did not change significantly after 3 months (P=0.70).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"CONCLUSIONS: Concordant with previous animal studies, cardiovascular magnetic resonance measures of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted signal intensity occur commensurate with small but significant left ventricular ejection fraction declines 3 months after the receipt of potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed blinded cardiovascular magnetic resonance analyses of left ventricular T1 and extracellular volume (ECV) fraction in 327 individuals (65% women, aged 64±12 years). Thirty-seven individuals had breast cancer or a hematologic malignancy but had not yet initiated their treatment, and 54 cancer survivors who received either anthracycline-based (n=37) or nonanthracycline-based (n=17) chemotherapy 2.8±1.3 years earlier were compared with 236 cancer-free participants. Multivariable analyses were performed to determine the association between T1/ECV measures and variables associated with myocardial fibrosis. Age-adjusted native T1 was elevated pre- (1058±7 ms) and post- (1040±7 ms) receipt of anthracycline chemotherapy versus comparators (965±3 ms; P<0.0001 for both). Age-adjusted ECV, a marker of myocardial fibrosis, was elevated in anthracycline-treated cancer participants (30.4±0.7%) compared with either pretreatment cancer (27.8±0.7%; P<0.01) or cancer-free comparators (26.9±0.2%; P<0.0001). T1 and ECV of nonanthracycline survivors were no different than pretreatment survivors (P=0.17 and P=0.16, respectively). Native T1 and ECV remained elevated in cancer survivors after accounting for demographics (including age), myocardial fibrosis risk factors, and left ventricular ejection fraction or myocardial mass index (P<0.0001 for all).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Because cardiac substructures are poorly visualized on treatment-planning computed tomography (CT) scans, we used the superior soft-tissue contrast of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to optimize a hybrid MR/CT atlas for substructure dose assessment using CT.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-one patients with left-sided breast cancer underwent a T2-weighted MR imaging scan and noncontrast simulation CT scans. A radiation oncologist delineated 13 substructures (chambers, great vessels, coronary arteries, etc) using MR/CT information via cardiac-confined rigid registration. Ground-truth contours for 20 patients were inputted into an intensity-based deformable registration atlas and applied to 11 validation patients. Automatic segmentations involved using majority vote and Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation (STAPLE) strategies with 1 to 15 atlas matches. Performance was evaluated via Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), mean distance to agreement, and centroid displacement. Three physicians evaluated segmentation performance via consensus scoring by using a 5-point scale. Dosimetric assessment included measurements of mean heart dose, left ventricular volume receiving 5 Gy, and left anterior descending artery mean and maximum doses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RESULTS: Atlas approaches performed similarly well, with 7 of 13 substructures (heart, chambers, ascending aorta, and pulmonary artery) having DSC >0.75 when averaged over 11 validation patients. Coronary artery segmentations were not successful with the atlas-based approach (mean DSC <0.3). The STAPLE method with 10 matches yielded the highest DSC and the lowest mean distance to agreement for all high-performing substructures (omitting coronary arteries). For the STAPLE method with 10 matches, >50% of all validation contours had centroid displacements <3.0 mm, with the largest shifts in the coronary arteries. Atlas-generated contours had no statistical difference from ground truth for left anterior descending artery maximum dose, mean heart dose, and left ventricular volume receiving 5 Gy (P > .05). Qualitative contour grading showed that 8 substructures required minor modifications.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Due to this, the time of disease-free course of cancer and the duration of life of patients have increased. However, a number of antitumor drugs have cardiotoxicity [1]. It is shown that cardiovascular diseases are the second leading cause of death among women who have undergone breast cancer [27]. Reduction of systolic function of the heart is the most common manifestation of cardiotoxicity of antitumor therapy [7]. Other manifestations of cardiotoxicity include arterial hypertension (AH), acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmias and thromboses. In recent years, methods such as electrocardiography (ECG)"; echocardiography (EchoCG) with the classical definition of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by the method of Simpson's biplane and the global longitudinal strain of the left ventricular (GLS) using data from the 2D Speckle Tracking Imaging;" determination of the level of biomarkers of myocardial damage and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart have been used to detect the cardiotoxicity of antitumor therapy. Thus, the early diagnosis and timely detection of cardiotoxic effects of antitumor drugs are among the tasks of cardiooncology - an area in medicine formed in recent years [1]."",,,Eurasian heart journal,,,,2018-09-30,2018,2018-09-30,,,3,50-61,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Avalyan, A.

However, the cardiovascular impact of CR-modeled interventions has not been studied. Objectives The purpose of this study was to evaluate if a multidisciplinary model of CR reduces cardiotoxicity and improves cardiovascular risk in patients undergoing breast cancer treatment. Methods We randomly assigned patients with stage I to III breast cancer scheduled to receive anthracycline and/or trastuzumab-based chemotherapy to the CR intervention (n = 37) or usual care (n = 37). The intervention included guideline-directed management of cardiovascular risk factors, dietary counselling, and supervised exercise for 52 weeks. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and serum biomarkers were acquired at baseline and 52 weeks. Results There was no difference in the primary outcome, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), between groups at 52 weeks (61% ± 6%). Other markers of cardiotoxicity, including high-sensitivity troponin I and brain natriuretic peptide, were similar between groups. However, total cholesterol (5.2 ± 0.8-4.7 ± 0.8 mmol/L, P = 0.002) and low-density lipoprotein (3.0 ± 0.7-2.4 ± 0.7 mmol/L, P < 0.001) decreased in the intervention group at 52 weeks and were unchanged in usual care. In all patients, adverse cardiac and metabolic changes occurred over 52 weeks including reductions in LVEF, left ventricular mass, high-density lipoprotein, lean body mass, insulin-like growth factor-1, as well as increased triglycerides, whole-body and truncal fat mass (all P < 0.050). Conclusions The CR-modeled intervention had no effect on LVEF or biomarkers of cardiotoxicity. Future lifestyle intervention trials in patients with breast cancer should consider targeting other risk factors associated with incident cardiovascular disease.

However, RT has been linked to long-term cardiac diseases. Therefore, detecting early signs of cardiotoxicity and determining the relationship between radiation dose to specific cardiac structures and subclinical cardiac changes is crucial for primary/secondary prevention. Purpose The EARLY HEART study aims to identify and validate new cardiac imaging and circulating biomarkers of radiation-induced cardiovascular changes arising in the first 2 years after breast cancer RT and to develop risk models integrating these biomarkers combined with precise dosimetry of cardiac structures. Methods EARLY HEART is a multicenter prospective cohort study that will include 250 unilateral breast cancer women aged 40 to 75 years treated with RT without chemotherapy and followed for 2 years. Baseline (before RT) and follow-up data (at the end of RT, RT+6, RT+24 months) include cardiac imaging measurements and circulating biomarkers. Myocardial deformation is evaluated with myocardial strain imaging (2D-speckle-tracking echocardiography). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is performed to detect subtle changes in cardiac function and structure. Cardiac computed tomography is performed to evaluate coronary artery lesions. Patients’ RT radiation dose is evaluated for the following cardiac structures: whole heart, left and right atrium, left and right ventricles, strain segments of the left ventricle and coronary arteries. Dose-response relationship will allow modeling radiation-induced occurrence and evolution of subclinical cardiac lesions and biomarkers in order to develop early cardiotoxicity prediction models. Results Five European centers are currently recruiting patients and end of follow-up is foreseen for 2020. Conclusion Based on emerging research in advanced imaging modalities and biomarkers, this study will allow enhanced detection and prediction of early cardiotoxicity and patients’ care."",,,Archives of Cardiovascular Diseases Supplements,,,,2019-01,2019,,2019-01,11,1,124-125,All OA";" Green,Article,""Walker, V."; Jacob, S.; Crijns, A.; Langendijk, J.; Spoor, D.; Vliegenthart, R.; Combs, S.; Mayinger, M.; Borm, K.; Eraso, A.; Guedea, F.; Fiuza, M.; Santos, S.

Materials and Methods A total of 152 patients diagnosed from 2010 to 2015 were included in the study. The PST consisted of a sequential regimen of taxanes and anthracyclines plus trastuzumab. The clinical and pathological responses and the type of breast cancer surgery were evaluated and correlated with clinical and biological factors. The cardiotoxicity profile and long-term benefits were analyzed.   Results The median patient age was 47 (37–67) years, with T2 and T3 67 (44.1%) and 85 (55.9%), respectively. Axillary lymph node breast cancer at diagnosis N0 was 104 (68.4%) and N1 and N2 were 28.9% and 2.6%, respectively. A total of 95.7% of patients had nonspecific type of breast cancer, 67% of tumors were hormonal receptor–negative, 75.5% were grade III, 100% Ki67 > 20%, and 90% of tumors were confirmed to be HER2/neu–positive through immunohistochemistry. Following PST, pathological complete response (pCR) rate was achieved in 44.7% evaluable patients. The pCR rate was higher in HR-negative (93.1% vs. 6.9%) cancer and in grade III (86.2%) than in grade I and II (13.8%) cancer"; only 75.5% of complete response (CR) on ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging were also CR on pathology results. Breast conserving surgery was performed in 41.4%. Regarding type of chemotherapy, there were no significant differences between chemotherapy with anthracycline backbone or taxanes to achieved pathological complete response. Despite that, we were unable to demonstrate an association between pCR and better DFS with p = 0.096; HR 5.7 95.0% CI (0.73–45.52). Patients who are hormonal receptor positive tend to have lower disease-free survival (DFS) than those who are hormonal receptor negative;" HR = 6.34, 95.0% CI (1.54–26.00) and p = 0.010. Five years DFS was higher for those who achieved pCR compare with those who did not. Even in this research we failed to show it is statistically significant.   Conclusion A sequential regimen of taxanes and anthracyclines plus trastuzumab was effective with high pCR rates and increases the possibility to do breast conservation surgery and had tolerable cardiotoxicity profile."",The authors thank all medical oncologists and surgical oncologists at Hasan Sadikin General Hospital for collecting and providing data and statistical analysis.,,Asian Journal of Oncology,,,,2021-04-29,2021,2021-04-29,,07,02,089-095,All OA";" Gold,Article,""Azhar, Yohana"; Agustina, Hasrayat;" Hernowo, Bethy"",""Azhar, Yohana (Division Oncology, Head and Neck Surgery, Department of Surgery, Hasan Sadikin General Hospital/Faculty of Medicine Universitas Padjadjaran, Bandung, West Java, Indonesia)"; Agustina, Hasrayat (Department of Pathology Anatomy, Hasan Sadikin General Hospital/Faculty of Medicine Universitas Padjadjaran, Bandung West Java, Indonesia);" Hernowo, Bethy (Department of Pathology Anatomy, Hasan Sadikin General Hospital/Faculty of Medicine Universitas Padjadjaran, Bandung West Java, Indonesia)"",,""Azhar, Yohana (Padjadjaran University)"; Agustina, Hasrayat (Padjadjaran University);" Hernowo, Bethy (Padjadjaran University)"",0,0,,0.0,http://www.thieme-connect.de/products/ejournals/pdf/10.1055/s-0041-1729481.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137607159,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences"; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

                    Cardiotoxicity during cancer treatment has become an acknowledged problem of chemotherapy medications and radiation therapy. Limitations of biomarkers and imaging tests such as echocardiography left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) hinder early detection of cardiotoxicity and proactive cardioprotective therapy. Once the heart is unable to compensate for subclinical dysfunction, systemic damage and remodeling occurs increasing the potential for heart failure. Fast-SENC segmental intramyocardial strain (fSENC) is a unique cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) test that regionally detects subclinical intramyocardial dysfunction in 1 heartbeat. This study evaluates the ability of fSENC to detect subclinical cardiotoxicity and manage cardioprotective therapy in cancer patients.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Main funding source(s): University Medical Centre Ljubljana Research Grant.   Introduction Early cardiotoxicity of modern radiotherapy (RT) is not known.   Purpose To study the early cardiotoxic effect of contemporary RT on myocardium with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in patients with breast cancer (BC).   Methods Patients with in-situ ductal carcinoma of the breast, scheduled for RT were included. All patients had undergone surgical tumorectomy. Exclusion criteria were prior systemic chemotherapy, prior RT or known cardiac disease. Patients were treated with 3-dimensional conformal RT or intensity-modulated RT, left-sided BC patients were also scheduled for deep inspiration breath hold protocol, if feasible. Patients underwent CMR imaging prior to RT and within 2 weeks after RT. Left and right ventricular volumes and ejection fraction, global native and postcontrast T1 values and T2 values, prior to and after completion of RT were analyzed. All patients provided written informed consent.   Results A total of 40 female patients (mean age 55 ± 7 years) were included, 22 with left-sided BC. The mean radiation dose was 42 Gy. CMR results are presented in Table 1. Left-sided BC patients had statistically significant increase in global T2 values. There were no significant differences in other studied parameters. No patient developed pericardial effusion and no patient had presence of late gadolinium enhancement at both exams.

Limited studies exist regarding fatigue as an early symptom of cardiotoxicity. HYPOTHESIS: Fatigue will occur in a majority of early stage breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy despite normal systolic function by echocardiogram and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 20 patients with stage I-IIb breast cancer undergoing adjuvant anthracycline or trastuzumab based chemotherapy. Mean age 49 ± 12 years. Seventeen patients completed all 4 time points. CMR, echocardiography and cardiac biomarkers were obtained at 4 different time-points: baseline, during chemotherapy and then 2 weeks and 6 months after completion of chemotherapy. A heart failure questionnaire was completed at each time point with physical examination. Statistics were analyzed by a linear mixed model. RESULTS: Symptoms of fatigue increased during chemotherapy but did not reach statistical significance (table 1). CMR detected significant increases in LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes and a significant decrease LV ejection fraction (table2). Biomarkers of cardiac injury troponin I, c-reactive protein, and brain natriuretic peptide did not change significantly. CONCLUSION: Transient fatigue occurred in a majority of patients during chemotherapy but was not clinically significant. However, transient increases in volumetric size did reach statistical significance and paralleled fatigue symptoms. These changes may indicate early cardiotoxicity.

                    Cancer treatments (CT) have been shown to occasionally elicit a toxic reaction on the heart. Echocardiography (ECHO) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) have been used to monitor cardiotoxicity through left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and global longitudinal strain (GLS). Fast-SENC (fSENC) CMR testing directly measures intramyocardial contraction to quantify subtle changes in function capable of detecting cardiotoxicity missed by conventional imaging modalities. The PREFECT study compares fast-SENC vs ECHO in terms of sensitivity of predicting and detecting subclinical (sCTX) or clinical cardiotoxicity (cCTX) irrespective of loading conditions or changes in cardiac output.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Both fSENC and CMR LVEF detected sCTX and cCTX based on ANOVA analysis (p<0.001) although fSENC had better delineation of both sCTX and cCTX. However, ECHO LVEF and GLS did not detect sCTX or cCTX (p=NS). CMR stroke volume index decreased while blood pressure and heart rate increased for both sCTX and cCTX (p<0.001). Meanwhile, mass index and end-systolic volume index increased for cCTX (p<0.001).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

 Patients and Methods: We randomized 126 patients with non-metastatic (M0) BC, who were scheduled to be treated with ANTC ± trastuzumab into the intervention group (group 1; n = 63), which received enalapril and carvedilol or the control group (group 2; n = 63), which did not receive enalapril or carvedilol. To evaluate left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic functions the conventional echocardiography (ECHO) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) were performed at baseline, after 3 therapy cycles, and at 1-year follow-up. The secondary endpoint was designed to detect the incidence of a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 10%, heart failure (HF), LVSD (defined as LVEF<45%) or deterioration in LV diastolic function.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Introduction Left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVD) is a key concern in the context of cardio-oncology (CO). Usually, referral for suspected Cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) is the main challenge, but heart failure with other more common causes, such as ischemic cardiomyopathy can also decompensate during cancer treatment or be diagnosed incidentally during cardiotoxicity echocardiographic (echo) surveillance. Multimodality imaging is essential in these patients in order to better establish aetiology and assure the most appropriate clinical management.   Purpose evaluate clinical impact of multimodality imaging in the clinical management of CO patients.   Methods retrospective study of a population followed in CO consultation. Statistical analysis of demographic, clinical, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) data was made.   Results we included 115 pts, mean age 66.3 ± 10.2 years, 67,8% female, with mean follow-up of 16.1 ± 12.8 months. About half (56.5%) had breast cancer, followed by gastrointestinal tract (16.5%) and haematological (8,7%) malignancies, with a significant proportion (32,2%) with advanced disease. Prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors was high (hypertension in 74.8%, dyslipidaemia in 47%, type 2 diabetes mellitus in 17.4%), but also coronary artery disease (18,3%) and atrial fibrillation (18.3%). All of them were treated with different types of chemotherapy and 53,9% of pts with radiotherapy.  At baseline, 13% of pts had a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) under 50% (LVD) assessed by TTE, which increased to 26,9% (n = 31) after oncological treatment initiation. Of these (n = 31), an ischemic aetiology was found in 32,3% and non-ischemic in 54,8%, which was significantly more frequent in patients with CTRCD (OR 2,7, p = 0,001). CMR was performed in 45,2%, mostly in CTRCD cases (p = 0,012, OR 8,4), which, apart from LVD, did not show any tissue changes in most patients (p = 0,026, OR 35). Only one patient with CTRCD (under treatment with trastuzumab and anthracyclines) had subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement, with wall motion abnormalities, suggesting a myocarditis-like mechanism for cardiotoxicity.   Conclusion LVD has a major impact in patients"""" prognosis, particularly in CO context, where effective oncological treatments can be compromised due heart failure decompensation. Therefore, a thorough clinical evaluation should encompass etiological study in order to provide the most appropriate treatment strategies. Moreover, CTRCD can develop through different physiopathological mechanisms. Thus, multimodality imaging, particularly including CMR evaluation, can have a major role ensuring a good clinical outcome for these patients."",,,European Heart Journal - Cardiovascular Imaging,,,,2022-02-04,2022,2022-02-04,2022-02-04,23,Supplement_1,jeab289.447,All OA";" Bronze,Article,""Saraiva, M"; Moura, AR; Castilho, B; Veiga, R; Domingues, K; Pitta, ML;" Martins, V"",""Saraiva, M (Hospital of Santarem, Cardiology, Santarem, Portugal)"; Moura, AR (Hospital of Santarem, Cardiology, Santarem, Portugal); Castilho, B (Hospital of Santarem, Cardiology, Santarem, Portugal); Veiga, R (Hospital of Santarem, Cardiology, Santarem, Portugal); Domingues, K (Hospital of Santarem, Cardiology, Santarem, Portugal); Pitta, ML (Hospital of Santarem, Cardiology, Santarem, Portugal);" Martins, V (Hospital of Santarem, Cardiology, Santarem, Portugal)"",,""Saraiva, M (Hospital of Santarem, Cardiology, Santarem, Portugal)"; Moura, AR (Hospital of Santarem, Cardiology, Santarem, Portugal); Castilho, B (Hospital of Santarem, Cardiology, Santarem, Portugal); Veiga, R (Hospital of Santarem, Cardiology, Santarem, Portugal); Domingues, K (Hospital of Santarem, Cardiology, Santarem, Portugal); Pitta, ML (Hospital of Santarem, Cardiology, Santarem, Portugal);" Martins, V (Hospital of Santarem, Cardiology, Santarem, Portugal)"",1,1,,,https://academic.oup.com/ehjcimaging/article-pdf/23/Supplement_1/jeab289.447/42395403/jeab289.447.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145371146,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences"; 3201 Cardiovascular Medicine and Haematology; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"991,pub.1148946908,10.1016/j.acvdsp.2022.04.131,,,Cardiac functional and structural abnormalities after adjuvant radiotherapy for breast cancer: Relation to cardiac radiation exposure,""Introduction Radiation therapy (RXT) is an essential tool in the treatment of breast cancer (BC). However the benefits of this therapy may be counterbalanced by increased cardiovascular morbidity due to radiation-induced late cardiotoxicity. High doses of cardiac radiation leads to diffuse and focal myocardial fibrosis on CMR, but contemporary BC-RXT is less studied. Objective Our objective was to assess the long-term cardiac safety of contemporary RXT for BC. We sought, therefore, to estimate the prevalence of functional and structural myocardial defects in BC survivors treated with RXT 10 years earlier, in direct relation to the radiation dose. Method In a prospective cross-sectional study, we examined 72 women (61±8 years) treated with adjuvant RXT but without chemotherapy or history of cardiac disease for a left (n =34) or right (n =38) BC between 2009 and 2013, and compared them to 23 age-matched healthy women (66±10 years). All underwent 3T cMRI to measure LV volumes and function, global strain, extracellular volume (ECV) and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). We also compared abnormalities in left and right BC patients and related them to the mean cardiac radiation dose (MHD) measured at the time of RXT (Fig. 1). Results MHD in BC survivors was 1.57±1.53Gy (range 0–7.9Gy). Exposure was significantly (P <0.001) higher in left-sided (2.62±1.72Gy) than in right-sided BC (0.72±0.49Gy). We did not observe any other difference between patients irradiated on the left and right side, or any significant correlation with MHD. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was significantly lower in patients than in controls (62±6% vs. 65±6%, P =0.006), and there was a trend for lower GLS (−15.6±1.8 vs. −14.7±1.8, P =0.07). GCS and GRS were not statistically different in BC survivors versus controls. Indexed LV mass was moderately reduced in patients (46±6 vs. 51±9g/m2, P =0.03), whereas end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes were similar (66.1±10.4 vs. 64.9±11.2ml/m2, P =NS). No patient developed LGE. ECV was similar in RXT-exposed patients (29.4±3.5) and in controls (28.5±3.0, P =NS). Conclusion Patients with BC treated with adjuvant RXT 10 years ago had a slightly but clinically not relevant lower LVEF and LV mass than controls. No other significant structural abnormalitie was detected, and no association was found between cardiac function and MHD. This suggests that current RXT protocols for BC are safe without long-term cardiac side effects."",,,Archives of Cardiovascular Diseases Supplements,,,,2022-06,2022,,2022-06,14,2,211,All OA";" Bronze,Article,""Krug, Pauline"; Hanet, Vincent; Altes, Alexandre; Duhoux, François; Beauloye, Christophe; Pouleur, Anne-Catherine; Berlière, Martine; Geets, Xavier;" Gerber, Bernhard"",""Krug, Pauline (Cardiologie, Cliniques Universitaire Saint Luc, Bruxelles, France)"; Hanet, Vincent (Cardiologie, Saint Luc Woluwe, Bruxelles, France); Altes, Alexandre (Cardiologie, Hôpital Saint Philibert, Lille, France); Duhoux, François (Oncologie, Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc (UCLouvain), Bruxelles, Belgique); Beauloye, Christophe (Cardiologie, Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc (UCLouvain), Bruxelles, Belgique); Pouleur, Anne-Catherine (Pathologies cardio-Vasculaires Intensives, Cliniques Saint-Luc, Bruxelles, Belgique); Berlière, Martine (Gynécologie, Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc (UCLouvain), Bruxelles, Belgique); Geets, Xavier (Radiothérapie, Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc (UCLouvain), Bruxelles, Belgique);" Gerber, Bernhard (Cardiologie, Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc (UCLouvain), Bruxelles, Belgique)"",""Krug, Pauline (Cardiologie, Cliniques Universitaire Saint Luc, Bruxelles, France)"",""Krug, Pauline (Cardiologie, Cliniques Universitaire Saint Luc, Bruxelles, France)"; Hanet, Vincent (Cardiologie, Saint Luc Woluwe, Bruxelles, France); Altes, Alexandre (Hôpital Saint-Philibert); Duhoux, François (Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc); Beauloye, Christophe (Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc); Pouleur, Anne-Catherine (Pathologies cardio-Vasculaires Intensives, Cliniques Saint-Luc, Bruxelles, Belgique); Berlière, Martine (Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc); Geets, Xavier (Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc);" Gerber, Bernhard (Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc)"",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acvdsp.2022.04.131,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148946908,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences"; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Hypoestrogenemia is associated with cardiotoxicity, but the cardiovascular impact of this newer breast cancer treatment is largely unknown. With increases in survival rates and younger women being diagnosed, methods to monitor and predict cardiac damage due to OFS+AI therapy are needed. Left ventricle (LV) ejection fraction is currently used for monitoring cancer treatment-related cardiovascular degradation, and can detect major heart defects, but is insensitive to subclinical left ventricle function. Emerging methods include T1 mapping and estimation of myocardial strain to indicate fibrosis. We propose an extension of these methods by estimating cardiac tissue elasticity using LV wall deformation to drive a biomechanical model. Elasticity is a more functional and direct measurement of tissue response based on structural mechanics driven by patient-specific cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) data. Elasticity measurements may serve as a predictive biomarker of early AI-induced cardiac changes.MethodsThis study is a retrospective initial proof-of-concept correlative imaging study to an existing clinical study for the use of CMR to detect cardiovascular damage (ESPRIT). Two cohorts of premenopausal breast cancer patients either: (1) undergoing OFS+AI for HR+ breast cancer or (2) triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients that have already received chemotherapy, were imaged twice, 3-6 months apart using CINE CMR. TNBC patients serve as the control, with no expectation of further cancer treatment-related cardiac damage. Time steps during passive ventricular diastole were visually selected from CINE CMRs. Each slice was non-rigidly registered to estimate LV deformation during passive filling. Deformation was simulated on a finite element mesh of the LV based on linear elastic transverse isotropic mechanical equilibrium. Using an inverse problem formulation, simulated deformation was compared to model-calculated deformation to estimate the spatial tissue longitudinal and transverse elasticity. Elasticity maps of the LV at initial and final points are compared to determine regional stiffening of the LV wall, to be used as early biomarkers for LV fibrosis. ResultsIn this initial investigation, elasticity maps were analyzed for four patients (n=2 from each cohort). Passive LV tissue stiffening was observed in each AI patient, with 100% and 25% relative increases observed for longitudinal elasticity and 50% increases for transverse elasticity in the basal inferior region, and mid anterior region of the LV in each patient, respectively. No increases in stiffness of the LV were observed for TNBC patients. Ejection fraction remained consistent for all patients. ConclusionIn this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate that elasticity maps indicate local stiffening of the LV using a biomechanical model-based elasticity imaging method that could be used to indicate cardiac dysfunction in breast cancer patients receiving AIs. Spatial elasticity mapping allows direct observation of structural mechanics to reveal specific areas of LV stiffening. Moving beyond traditional strain imaging, our method yields a functional measure of tissue stiffness to directly indicate cardiac fibrosis. This study demonstrates the use of biomechanical models to interpret CMR and provides potential for use of more advanced constitutive models. Our non-invasive biomechanical model-based elasticity imaging method shows significant promise to indicate early cardiac function deterioration, critical for premenopausal women undergoing extended cancer therapies.

"                  Background: Introduction of anthracycline or trastuzumab based regimen for various types of cancer during the past two decades led to substantial improvement in life expectancy, yet resulting in increased prevalence of unintended side effects. Left ventricular systolic dysfunction is a known complication of the currently employed chemotherapy regimens with anthracycline or trastuzumab which not only affects patient’s cardiac outcome but also limits their therapeutic opportunities, especially continuation or reintroduction of chemotherapy treatment. We aimed to perform comprehensive network meta analysis to synthesize data from randomized clinical trials (RCT) comparing all modern regimens to prevent cardiotoxicity in such patients. Methods: We performed a comprehensive search of pubmed, embase, google scholar and TRIP database for all RCT comparing cardioprotective effects of medication in patients with various types of cancer on chemotherapy with either an anthracycline or trastuzumab based regimen from 1997 to 2019. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was measured by transthoracic echocardiogram or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Patients treated with either Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-Inhibitor(ACE) or Angiotensin receptor blocker(ARB) were combined into one group. Primary outcome was change in LVEF between start and end of the chemotherapy. Network meta-analyses were conducted using consistency and inconsistency models. Results: A total of 16 studies with 1459 patients were included in the analysis where either an Anthracycline or Trastuzumab based chemotherapy regimen was administered. 369 patients received beta blockers(BB), 351 received either an ACE or ARB, 61 received a combination of BB and either an ACE or ARB, 20 received a statin and 657 were given a placebo. The primary cancer was breast cancer in 8 studies, one each of lymphoma, blood cancers and remaining 6 being mixed. Mean age was 48.81 years. Compared to patients on placebo there was a significant cardioprotective effect (smaller reduction in LVEF) noted with ACE/ARB (beta coef 5.2 (1.5-8.9), p<0.01), BB(beta coef 4.62 (0.8-7.8), p<0.02), and spironolactone beta coef 12.9 (1.9-23.4), p<0.03) There was an evidence of inconsistency with all p>0.3, other than in spironolactone arm as there were suggestion of inconsistency with p<0.01 likely due to the presence of single study. Conclusions: BB and ACE/ARB are associated with reduction in cardiotoxicity in patients with cancer undergoing cancer chemotherapy with an anthracycline or trastuzumab based regimen."",,,Journal of Clinical Oncology,,,,2019-05-20,2019,,2019-05-20,37,15_suppl,e12008-e12008,Closed,Article,""Kancharla, Pragnan";" Ivanov, Alexander"",""Kancharla, Pragnan (New York-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital, Brooklyn, NY";); Ivanov, Alexander (New York Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital, Brooklyn, NY;")"",,""Kancharla, Pragnan (NewYork–Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital)";" Ivanov, Alexander (NewYork–Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital)"",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1115945614,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences"; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This can occur as an early, acute manifestation or many years after treatment as late onset cardiomyopathy. It is increasingly apparent that there may be a chronic subclinical phase associated with low grade cardiac injury with no apparent clinical impact on the contractile function of the heart. This period may remain latent for many years with the patient remaining asymptomatic and with apparently normal cardiac function. Identification of early and subtle cardiac dysfunction during this period could provide a window of opportunity for therapeutic intervention if those at risk or those experiencing this low-grade decline could be accurately identified. This study explores the potential utility of phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) to identify very early anthracycline-induced cardiac toxicity and baseline predisposition to cardiac injury. This technique measures the phosphocreatine/adenosine triphosphate concentration ratio (PCr/ATP), which reflects cardiac cellular energetics. The normal range of PCr/ATP is approximately 1.8 - 2.2, whereas decreased PCr/ATP is associated with a drop in available energy reserve in the heart, associated with many forms of heart failure. Conventional cardiac investigations of electrocardiogram, multiple gated acquisition radionuclide scans (MUGA) and ultra-high sensitivity plasma cardiac troponin-I (cTn-I) have also been applied. METHODS 20 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients, receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy, had magnetic resonance imaging to assess left ventricular ejection fraction and 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P MRS) to assess phosphocreatine to adenosine triphosphate concentration ratio (“PCr/ATP”). Measurements were performed pre-chemo, mid-chemo and post-chemo. Plasma high sensitivity cardiac troponin-I (cTn-I) and electrocardiograms were performed. RESULTS There was a significant negative correlation between change in PCr/ATP pre- to mid- chemo and change mid- to post-chemo (r=-0.68, p=0.04). Mean ejection fraction reduced significantly (5.1%) pre- to post-chemo (p=0.02). Change in PCr/ATP ratios pre- to post-chemo correlated inversely with changes in LVEF over the same period (r=-0.65, p=0.006) and mid- to post-chemotherapy (r=-0.77, p=0.002). Plasma cTn-I increased pre- to mid-chemo (1.35±0.81 to 4.40±2.64 ng/L"; p=0.0001) and mid to post-chemo (4.40±2.64 to 18.33±13.23 ng/L; p=0.0001). CONCLUSIONS This study has demonstrated the use of 31P MRS in exploring cardiac energetics of breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Pre-chemotherapy PCr/ATP ratios were in line with healthy control values obtained using our system. This technique detected a pattern of recovery of PCr/ATP ratios following an initial 3 cycles of anthracyclines. Changes in PCr/ATP ratios were found to be significantly negatively correlated with changes in LVEF from pre to post chemotherapy. The significant decrease in LVEF from pre-post chemo may be due to the delayed response of LVEF to the initial 3 cycles of anthracyclines. Small but significant increases in plasma levels of cardiac troponin-I were observed early after initiation of anthracyclines. PCr/ATP ratios were not found to be related to cTn-I values but LVEF and cTn-I were found to be positively correlated. Future studies should take account of background factors that could influence cardiac PCr/ATP ratio such as age, physical fitness and regular medication whilst the improved sensitivity of 7T MRI scanners may also help in detecting earlier changes in cardiac energetics in this patient group.

"828,pub.1139667341,10.1093/ehjci/jeab090.129,,,Myocardial functional and structural abnormalities after adjuvant radiotherapy for breast cancer. Relation to cardiac radiation exposure,""Abstract  Funding Acknowledgements Type of funding sources: Foundation. Main funding source(s): The Funds Pierre Masure, Alphonse and Marie Walckiers & De Winter-Vermant, by King Baudouin Foundation   Background Radiation therapy (RXT) is a keystone in breast cancer (BC) treatment which allows to reduce risk of local recurrence and cancer related mortality. Yet these benefits may be offset by increases in cardiovascular mortality due to late radiation induced cardiotoxicity. Indeed, prior works in patients exposed to high cardiac radiation dose demonstrated development of diffuse and focal myocardial fibrosis by cMR. However, whether such effects may also occur after contemporary BC-RXT with lower cardiac dose exposure, has not yet been evaluated.   Purpose To evaluate the long-term cardiac safety of contemporary RXT for BC, we sought to estimate the prevalence of cardiac functional and structural focal and myocardial abnormalities in BC survivors treated by RXT 10 years earlier, in direct relation to measured local radiation dose exposure.   Methods In a prospective cross-sectional study, we studied 27 women (mean age 62 ± 7 years) treated with adjuvant RXT but without chemotherapy for a first left (n= 12) or right sided (n= 15) BC between 2009 and 2011, which had no history of coronary artery or cardiac disease and compared them to 20 age matched (64 ± 10 years) healthy female controls (without history of BC or RXT). All subjects underwent 3T cMR to measure LV volumes, function, global longitudinal (GLS), circumferential (GRS) and radial strains (GRS) as well as extracellular volume (ECV) and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Functional and structural abnormalities in women with BC were compared to healthy controls. We also compared abnormalities among patients with left vs right BC and related them to mean heart radiation dose measured at the time of RXT (Figure).   Results Mean cardiac radiation exposure in BC survivors was 1.87 ± 1.7 Gy (range 0-7.9 Gy). Exposure was significantly (p < 0.001) higher in left (3.3 ± 0.66 Gy) than in right (0.84 ± 0.65 Gy) sided BC. Indexed LV mass was slightly lower in BC patients than in controls (46 ± 6 vs 51 ± 9 g/m2, p = 0.03), whereas indexed end-diastolic (66 ± 11 vs 66 ± 12 ml/m2, p = NS) and end-systolic volumes (25 ± 8 vs 24 ± 7 ml/m2, p = NS) were similar. Also, LV ejection fraction (63 ± 6 vs 64 ± 6, p = NS), GLS (-14.7 ± 1.9 vs -15.5 ± 1.8, p = NS), GCS (-20.0 ± 3.6 vs -19.3 ± 5.9, p = NS) and GRS (40.9 ± 10.7 vs 37.0 ± 9.0, p = NS) were not statistically different in BC survivors than in controls. No patient presented LGE, and ECV was similar in BC patients exposed to RXT (28.3 ± 2.8) than in controls (29.3 ± 2.4, p = 0.58). Also, no differences in ECV between left and right sided BC and no statistical correlation between ECV and mean heart dose (r = 0.01, p = NS) was observed.   Conclusions In this preliminary work, patients with BC treated by adjuvant RXT 10 years ago, presented no significant structural or functional abnormalities in relation to cardiac dose exposure nor in comparison to healthy controls. This suggests that current RXT protocols for BC are safe without long-term functional or morphological cardiac side effects."",,,European Heart Journal - Cardiovascular Imaging,,,,2021-07-13,2021,2021-07-13,2021-07-13,22,Supplement_2,,All OA";" Bronze,Article,""Krug, P"; Berliere, M; Kirkove, C; Ledoux, B; Pasquet, A; Vancraeynest, D; Beauloye, C; Pouleur, AC; Geets, X;" Gerber, BL"",""Krug, P (Cliniques Saint-Luc UCL, Brussels, Belgium)"; Berliere, M (Cliniques Saint-Luc UCL, Brussels, Belgium); Kirkove, C (Cliniques Saint-Luc UCL, Brussels, Belgium); Ledoux, B (Cliniques Saint-Luc UCL, Brussels, Belgium); Pasquet, A (Cliniques Saint-Luc UCL, Brussels, Belgium); Vancraeynest, D (Cliniques Saint-Luc UCL, Brussels, Belgium); Beauloye, C (Cliniques Saint-Luc UCL, Brussels, Belgium); Pouleur, AC (Cliniques Saint-Luc UCL, Brussels, Belgium); Geets, X (Cliniques Saint-Luc UCL, Brussels, Belgium);" Gerber, BL (Cliniques Saint-Luc UCL, Brussels, Belgium)"",,""Krug, P (Cliniques Saint-Luc UCL, Brussels, Belgium)"; Berliere, M (Cliniques Saint-Luc UCL, Brussels, Belgium); Kirkove, C (Cliniques Saint-Luc UCL, Brussels, Belgium); Ledoux, B (Cliniques Saint-Luc UCL, Brussels, Belgium); Pasquet, A (Cliniques Saint-Luc UCL, Brussels, Belgium); Vancraeynest, D (Cliniques Saint-Luc UCL, Brussels, Belgium); Beauloye, C (Cliniques Saint-Luc UCL, Brussels, Belgium); Pouleur, AC (Cliniques Saint-Luc UCL, Brussels, Belgium); Geets, X (Cliniques Saint-Luc UCL, Brussels, Belgium);" Gerber, BL (Cliniques Saint-Luc UCL, Brussels, Belgium)"",0,0,,0.0,https://academic.oup.com/ehjcimaging/article-pdf/22/Supplement_2/jeab090.129/38938154/jeab090.129.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139667341,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences"; 3211 Oncology and Carcinogenesis,3 Good Health and Well Being;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This treatment improves recurrence-free survival but may increase cardiovascular (CV) risk associated with early hypoestrogenemia as observed in women with non-cancerous reasons for early loss of ovarian function. We sought to identify if OFS+AI therapy is associated with myocardial perfusion changes, a subclinical marker of coronary heart disease. Methods: We evaluated women with paired adenosine cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging scans at 3-to 6-month intervals using cines and T1 maps in standard short-axis planes. As increased blood flow from vasodilation increases adenosine stress parametric T1 values of the myocardial tissue, the myocardial perfusion reactivity was calculated from the percent increase of stress versus native (pre-stress) T1 maps. Double-blinded post-processing of images was performed in CircleCVI software. Statistical analyses were performed in MATLAB (p<0.05 defined as statistically significant) using paired t-tests for within-group comparisons and two-sample t-tests for between-group comparisons. Results: Twenty-one premenopausal women (16 Caucasian, 5 African American"; median age 44.7 years) were accrued in 16 months - 14 with HR+ BC within 3 years of initiating OFS+AI (median 8 months) and 7 with triple negative BC within 3 years of chemotherapy (median 10 months) for comparators. Global myocardial perfusion reactivity to adenosine stress declined in HR+ women on OFS+AI therapy during the 3-6 month study interval (-1.3%; 95%CI: -3.4-0.7%) which was significantly different (p=0.02) from changes observed in comparators who had an improvement in perfusion during the interval (3.2%; 95%CI: -1.2-7.6%) (Table). Left ventricular (LV) function remained unchanged during the 3-6 month interval for all groups (p>0.05). The cardiovascular stress tests identified two HR+ women (14%) with abnormal results during stress imaging who were sent for further cardiovascular evaluations.Conclusions: Women with HR+ BC treated with OFS+AI exhibited a decline in global microcirculatory perfusion during an adenosine cardiac stress test with normal LV functional parameters. Alternatively, triple negative BC patients trended to have an improvement in LV function during the interval with non-significant improvement in myocardial perfusion. This study demonstrates a decline in myocardial perfusion in premenopausal women on OFS+AI therapy, suggesting subclinical coronary artery effects due to early hypoestrogenemia. Future work should confirm these results, identify women at higher risk, and test strategies to mitigate cardiotoxicity in premenopausal women with HR+ BC.
